[id="Vdsm_To_Network_Mapping_Tool"]
= Mapping VDSM Names to Logical Network Names

If the name of a logical network is longer than 15 characters or contains non-ASCII characters, the system automatically generates an on-host identifier (_vdsm_name_) name; it comprises the letters _on_ and the first 13 characters of the network's unique identifier, for example, `ona1b2c3d4e5f6g`. It is this name that appears in the host's log files. To view a list of logical network names and their auto-generated network name, use the  VDSM-to-Network-Name Mapping tool located in `/usr/share/ovirt-engine/bin/`.

.Procedure
. The first time you run the tool, define a PASSWORD environment variable, which is the password of a database user with read access to the {engine-name} database. 
For example, run:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# export PASSWORD=_DatabaseUserPassword_
----

. Run the VDSM-to-Network-Name Mapping tool:
+
----
# vdsm_to_network_name_map  --user USER
----
where _USER_ is the database user with read access to the {engine-name} database, whose password is assigned to the PASSWORD environment variable.

The tool displays a list of logical network names that are mapped to their equivalent on-host identifiers.

.Additional Flags
You can run the tool with the following flags:

`--host` is the hostname/IP address of the database server. The default value is `localhost`.

`--port` is the port number of the database server. The default value is `5432`.
`--database` is the name of the database. The default value is `engine`, which is the {engine-name} database.

`--secure` enables a secure connection with the database. By default the tool is run without a secure connection.
