# oVirt 4.2.5 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.5 release as of July 30, 2018.

Release has been updated on August 10, 2018.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5,
CentOS Linux 7.5 (or similar).


For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.5, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### No Fedora support

Regretfully, Fedora is not supported anymore, and RPMs for it are not provided.
These are still built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
At this point, we only try to fix problems specific to Fedora if they affect
developers. For some of the work to be done to restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## What's New in 4.2.5?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1605076](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1605076) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.5] Config values inconsistency between RHV versions</b><br>There were inconsistencies in the following internal configuration options:<br><br>* HotPlugCpuSupported<br>* HotUnplugCpuSupported<br>* HotPlugMemorySupported<br>* HotUnplugMemorySupported<br>* IsMigrationSupported<br>* IsMemorySnapshotSupported<br>* IsSuspendSupported<br>* ClusterRequiredRngSourcesDefault<br><br>If you are having issues with these features, upgrade to Red Hat Virtualization 4.2.5+ to resolve the problem.

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1568893](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1568893) <b>Alert when guaranteed capacity reaches a threshold value</b><br>Feature: Notification on running our of physical space.<br><br>Reason: With VDO and Thin pool support, users may see more space, that it is available physically. This is totally fine and with VDO it is an expected behavior. At the same time, we can't predict, how much data user will be able to actually write. Because of that, to keep user informed, we would like to notify him, when he is running out of physical space and, at the same time, show him how much confirmed space he have.<br><br>Result: When actually used space of the thin device goes above configured threshold, event will be issued.
 - [BZ 1608362](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1608362) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.5] [RFE] Disable Event notification popup in admin portal</b><br>This update adds a feature to control pop up notifications. Once 3 or more notifications are showing, "Dismiss" and "Do not disturb" buttons will appear that allow the user to silence notifications.
 - [BZ 1572158](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1572158) <b>[RFE] add disk sizes in Disk general tab</b><br>
 - [BZ 1574771](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1574771) <b>[RFE] Provide a friendly interface (UI + REST) for virtio multiqueue network interfaces</b><br>Feature: Multi Queue<br><br>Reason: Better performance.<br><br>Result: This feature is adding new property to the VM, 'Multi Queues Enabled'.<br>'Multi Queues' will be enabled by default.<br><br>Each vnic of a VM with 'Multi Queue' enabled will get min(num_of_vCpus, 4) queues.<br><br>Note: Queues configured via the vnic profile's custom properties will override the 'Mutli Queues'.
 - [BZ 1591730](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1591730) <b>[RFE] allow a ui-plugin to set an icon on its left nav</b><br>This feature allows ui plugins to set an icon on their main menu navigation item.
 - [BZ 1601514](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1601514) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.5] [RFE] Changes that require Virtual Machine restart: name</b><br>
 - [BZ 1580386](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1580386) <b>'Enable IO threads' should be checked by default (or at least for Server VM type)</b><br>
 - [BZ 1443963](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1443963) <b>[RFE] Expose API to reduce a volume</b><br>Feature:<br><br>Added 'reduce' action on disk in the API:<br><br>POST /ovirt-engine/api/disks/cc9ce0d3-f651-4d86-94e6-0e4e5cfde3ce/reduce<br><br>Reduces the size of the specified disk image. The action invokes 'lvreduce' on the logical volume (i.e. this is only applicable for block storage domains). This is applicable for floating disks and disks attached to non-running virtual machines. There is no need to specify the size as the optimal size is calculated automatically.
 - [BZ 1451342](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1451342) <b>configure guest MTU based on underlying network</b><br>Feature:<br>The feature adds the ability to manage the MTU of VM networks in a centralized way. This extends the ability of oVirt to manage the MTU of host networks.<br><br>Reason: <br>This feature enables the usage of big MTUs ("Jumbo Frames") for OVN networks. This improves the network throughput for OVN networks.<br><br>Result:<br>The MTU of the network is propagated the whole way down to the guest in the VM.
 - [BZ 1136916](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1136916) <b>[RFE] Add visual element to LUNs already in use by Storage domain in add External (Direct Lun) screen</b><br>Feature: <br>Add a visual element to LUNs already in use by storage domain in add External (Direct Lun) screen.<br><br>Reason: <br>Having the visual element will allow the user to skip such LUNs more efficiently.<br><br>Result:<br>LUNs which are already used by an external storage domain won't be able to be selected and appear as grayed out with an N/A button on the 'Actions' column.
 - [BZ 1197685](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1197685) <b>[RFE] SR-IOV > Add tooltip on the PF with info about --> 'Number of enabled VFs' and ' How many and which VFs are free/in use) in the Setup Networks dialog (GUI)</b><br>

#### oVirt Hosted Engine HA

 - [BZ 1193961](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1193961) <b>[RFE] [hosted-engine] [iSCSI multipath] Support hosted engine deployment based on multiple iSCSI initiators</b><br>

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1193961](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1193961) <b>[RFE] [hosted-engine] [iSCSI multipath] Support hosted engine deployment based on multiple iSCSI initiators</b><br>

#### oVirt Provider OVN

 - [BZ 1593676](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1593676) <b>[RFE] Provide static routes support for routers</b><br>This feature adds static routes support to ovirt-provider-ovn, as specified in<br>https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/network/v2/#routers-routers<br><br>The appropriate REST request for this is as follows:<br>{<br>"router": {<br>  "routes": [<br>   {<br>      "destination": "179.24.1.0/24",<br>       "nexthop": "172.24.3.99"<br>   },<br>  ...

#### oVirt Engine Dashboard

 - [BZ 1591730](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1591730) <b>[RFE] allow a ui-plugin to set an icon on its left nav</b><br>This feature allows ui plugins to set an icon on their main menu navigation item.

### Rebase: Bug Fixeses and Enhancementss

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1596234](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1596234) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.5] Virtual machine lost its cdrom device</b><br>Previously, when a virtual machine's cluster level was updated (for example, from 4.1 to 4.2), ejected CD-ROM devices could be lost, and the virtual machine was sometimes unable to use CDs anymore. This has now been fixed so that CD-ROM devices remain intact during upgrades regardless of whether they are in use or ejected.

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1600595](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1600595) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.5] add AMD EPYC SSBD CPU</b><br>
