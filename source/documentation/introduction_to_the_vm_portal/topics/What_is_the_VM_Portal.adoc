== What is the VM Portal?

The VM Portal presents a comprehensive view of a virtual machine and allows the user to start, stop, edit, and view details of a virtual machine.
The actions available to a user in the VM Portal are set by a system administrator.
System administrators can delegate additional administration tasks to a user, such as:

* Create, edit, and remove virtual machines

* Manage virtual disks and network interfaces

* Create and use snapshots to restore virtual machines to previous states

Direct connection to virtual machines is facilitated with SPICE or VNC clients. Both protocols provide the user with an environment similar to a locally installed desktop. The administrator specifies the protocol used to connect to a virtual machine at the time of the virtual machineâ€™s creation.
