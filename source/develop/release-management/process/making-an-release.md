# Making an oVirt release

The purpose of this document is to provide instructions on how to prepare a release for oVirt project followiing the transition to external providers for
the git hosting and build execution.

## Development phase

During the development of the next oVirt release, patches are being verified using GitHub Actions.
Once a PR is merged, the pakages are being built by COPR infrastructure within [ovirt/ovirt-master-snapshot](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ovirt/ovirt-master-snapshot/) project.

Manual and automated testing can then be done using the [snapshot composes provided by COPR](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot.html).

Instructions on how to get your package added to this flow are provided here:
- [Migrating a project from Gerrit to GitHub](/develop/developer-guide/migrating_to_github.html)
- [Adding a project to ovirt-master-snapshot COPR repository](/develop/release-management/process/add_a_package_to_copr.html)

## Pre release phase

A pre release (alpha, beta, release candidate) should be built from tagged content.
In order to do that we are going to use the [CentOS Community Build Service (CBS)](https://cbs.centos.org/koji/).

Package maintainers must have a [CentOS Account](https://accounts.centos.org/) or a [Fedora Account](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/)
which at the time of writing this article are exactly the same account system.

In order to build for oVirt you need to be added to the CBS you need to join the [CentOS Virtualization SIG](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Virtualization).
You can do that by attending a [Virt SIG IRC meeting](https://www.centos.org/community/calendar/#virtualization-sig)
or asking on the [CentOS Virt mailing list](https://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-virt)

> Please note that if you want to ship oVirt packages in other distributions you'll need to get permissions there.
> For example, if you want to ship for Fedora, you need to be package owner on [Fedora Build System](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/).
>
> At the time of writing, the oVirt project is focusing only on [CentOS Stream](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/).

The build process on the [Community Build Service is documented on the CentOS website](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CommunityBuildSystem).

A typycal build is done by taking a src.rpm from the COPR [ovirt/ovirt-master-snapshot Builds](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ovirt/ovirt-master-snapshot/builds/)
and rebuilding with:

```bash
# This builds a scratch (just a test) build for CentOS Stream 9 for oVirt 4.5
cbs build --scratch virt9s-ovirt-45-el9s <your package .src.rpm>

# This is for CentOS Stream 8:
cbs build --scratch virt8s-ovirt-45-el8s <your package .src.rpm>

# if the build goes fine you can build for real
# CentOS Stream 9:
cbs build virt9s-ovirt-45-el9s <your package .src.rpm>

# CentOS Stream 8:
cbs build virt8s-ovirt-45-el8s <your package .src.rpm>
```

Once the builds complete it will be tagged as candidate to be released as `virt8s-ovirt-45-candidate` (for CentOS Stream 8) or `virt9s-ovirt-45-candidate` (for CentOS Stream 9).

In order to publish the build you need to tag it for testing:

```bash
# CentOS Stream 8
cbs tag virt8s-ovirt-45-testing <your build without the trailing '.src.rpm'>

#example:
cbs tag virt8s-ovirt-45-testing ovirt-hosted-engine-ha-2.4.10-1.el8
```

this will publish the build on https://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/8-stream/virt/ repository.


```bash
# CentOS Stream 9
cbs tag virt9s-ovirt-45-testing <your build without the trailing '.src.rpm'>

#example:
cbs tag virt9s-ovirt-45-testing ovirt-hosted-engine-ha-2.4.10-1.el9
```

this will publish the build on https://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/9-stream/virt/ repository.


## Release phase

Once the content in testing has been properly verified and considered good to be released for general availability you'll need to tag your builds for release:

```bash
# CentOS Stream 8
cbs tag virt8s-ovirt-45-release <your build without the trailing '.src.rpm'>

#example:
cbs tag virt8s-ovirt-45-release ovirt-hosted-engine-ha-2.4.10-1.el8
```

this will publish the build on http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8-stream/virt/ repository and to all CentOS mirrors.


```bash
# CentOS Stream 9
cbs tag virt9s-ovirt-45-release <your build without the trailing '.src.rpm'>

#example:
cbs tag virt9s-ovirt-45-release ovirt-hosted-engine-ha-2.4.10-1.el9
```

this will publish the build on http://mirror.stream.centos.org/SIGs/9-stream/virt/ repository and to all CentOS mirrors.

## Release notes preparation

Release notes can be autogenerated from git logs.
Please follow instructions on [oVirt Release Engineering Tools documentation](https://github.com/oVirt/releng-tools/blob/master/releases/README-prepare-patches).

Once ready, the notes can be automatically generated with [`release_notes_git.py`](https://github.com/oVirt/releng-tools/blob/master/release_notes_git.py) command line like:

```bash
# this assumes milestone/ovirt-4.5.0.conf being already populated
# https://github.com/oVirt/releng-tools/blob/master/milestones/ovirt-4.5.0.conf
 ./release_notes_git.py --git-basedir /var/tmp/release-cache --contrib-project-list ovirt-4.5.0 >notes.md
```
