= Upgrading the {engine-name} from 4.2 to 4.3

Upgrade the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} from 4.2 to 4.3.

// Included in:
// Upgrade Guide

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the upgrade fails, the `engine-setup` command attempts to roll your {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} installation back to its previous state. For this reason, the previous version's repositories must not be removed until after the upgrade is complete. If the upgrade fails, detailed instructions display that explain how to restore your installation.
