==== Managing System Permissions for a Cluster

As the *SuperUser*, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a *DataCenterAdmin* role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a *ClusterAdmin* has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.

A cluster administrator is a system administration role for a specific cluster only. This is useful in data centers with multiple clusters, where each cluster requires a system administrator. The *ClusterAdmin* role is a hierarchical model: a user assigned the cluster administrator role for a cluster can manage all objects in the cluster. Use the *Configure* button in the header bar to assign a cluster administrator for all clusters in the environment.

The cluster administrator role permits the following actions:

* Create and remove associated clusters.

* Add and remove hosts, virtual machines, and pools associated with the cluster.

* Edit user permissions for virtual machines associated with the cluster.



[NOTE]
====
You can only assign roles and permissions to existing users.
====
You can also change the system administrator of a cluster by removing the existing system administrator and adding the new system administrator.
