=== Red Hat Virtualization 4.4 Batch Update 2 (ovirt-4.5.2)



==== Bug Fix

These bugs were fixed in this release of Red Hat Virtualization:

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1955388[1955388]::
Previously, the Manager could start a virtual machine with a Resize and Pin NUMA policy on a host that does not have an equal number of physical sockets to the number of NUMA nodes it has. As a result, the wrong pinning was assigned to the policy. With this release, the Manager does not allow the virtual machine to be scheduled on such a virtual machine, making the pinning correct based on the algorithm.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2097558[2097558]::
Previously, running engine-setup did not necessarily renew OVN certificates when they were close to expiration or expired. With this release, OVN certificates are always renewed by engine-setup when needed.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2097725[2097725]::
Previously, the Manager issued warnings about approaching certificate expiration before engine-setup could update the certificates. In this release the expiration warning and certificate update periods are aligned, and certificates are updated as soon as the warnings about their upcoming expiration occur.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2101481[2101481]::
The handling of core dumps during upgrade from previous Red Hat Virtualization versions to RHV 4.4 SP1 batch 1, has been fixed.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2104115[2104115]::
Previously, when importing a virtual machine with manual CPU pinning (pinned to a dedicated host), the manual pinning string was cleared, but the CPU pinning policy was not set to NONE. As a result, importing failed.
In this release, the CPU pinning policy is set to NONE if the CPU pinning string is cleared, and importing succeeds.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2105781[2105781]::
The hosted-engine-ha binaries have been moved from /usr/share to /usr/libexec. As a result, the hosted-engine --clean-metadata command fails. With this release, 
you must use the new path for the command to succeed: /usr/libexec/ovirt-hosted-engine-ha/ovirt-ha-agent

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2109923[2109923]::
Previously, it was not possible to import templates from the Administration Portal.
With this release, importing templates from the  Administration Portal is now possible.

==== Enhancements

This release of Red Hat Virtualization features the following enhancements:

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1793207[1793207]::
$ vdsm-tool is-configured --module multipath
WARNING: Invalid configuration: 'user_friendly_names' is
enabled in multipath configuration:
  section1 {
    key1 value1
    user_friendly_names yes
    key2 value2
  }
  section2 {
    user_friendly_names yes
  }
This configuration is not supported and may lead to storage domain corruption.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2097536[2097536]::
In this release, the rhv-log-collector-analyzer now provides a detailed output for each problematic image, including disk names, associated virtual machine, the host running the virtual machine, snapshots, and the current SPM. This makes it easier to identify problematic virtual machines and collect SOS reports for related systems.
The detailed view is now the default, and the compact option can be set by using the â€“compact switch in the command line.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2097560[2097560]::
Expiration of ovirt-provider-ovn certificate is now checked regularly along with other RHV certificates (such as engine CA, engine, or hypervisors) and if ovirt-provider-ovn is going to expire or already expired, the warning or alert is raised to the audit log. To renew the ovirt-provider-ovn certificate, administators need to run engine-setup.
If your ovirt-provider-ovn certificate expires on a previous RHV version, please upgrade to RHV 4.4 SP1 batch 2 or newer, and ovirt-provider-ovn certificate will be renewed automatically as a part of engine-setup.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2104939[2104939]::
With this release, OVA export or import work on hosts with a non-standard SSH port.

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2107250[2107250]::
With this release, the process to check certificate validity is now compatible with both RHEL 8 and RHEL 7 based hypervisors.
