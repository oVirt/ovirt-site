# Promote oVirt

Basically any and all mentions of oVirt are a good thing to build the awareness for the project.
This can take the form of press, blogs, twitter, meetups, workshops or even sessions or speaking slots that any in the community gets to speak about oVirt.

This pages have been created to help the oVirt community to be more effective in promoting itself.
