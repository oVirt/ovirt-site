# Backend Coding Standards

This page is a collection of coding standards in the ovirt engine backend. Not all of these standards are properly maintained, they are more like 'guidelines'

## Java code conventions

Java code style conventions and best practices should be applied in the project.

## RowMapper singletons

RowMappers should have a single instance e.g.

      private final static class FooRowMapper implements ParameterizedRowMapper`<Foo>` {
        public final static FooRowMapper instance = new FooRowMapper();
        public Foo mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) {
          //and so on...
        }
      }

So you do not have to instantiate the rowmapper all the time.

# To be cleared

## Logger

Seems like there is no clear agreement on how the loggers should be declared. What is known is that it should be the 'compat' logger.
