# VDSM

The VDSM service is used by the Red Hat Virtualization Manager to manage Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts. VDSM manages and monitors the host's storage, memory and network resources. It also co-ordinates virtual machine creation, statistics gathering, log collection and other host administration tasks. VDSM is run as a daemon on each host managed by Red Hat Virtualization Manager. It answers XML-RPC calls from clients. The Red Hat Virtualization Manager functions as a VDSM client.
