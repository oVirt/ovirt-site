= Customizing Multipath Configurations for SAN Vendors

If your RHV environment is configured to use multipath connections with SANs, you can customize the multipath configuration settings to meet requirements specified by your storage vendor. These customizations can override both the default settings and settings that are specified in `/etc/multipath.conf`.

To override the multipath settings, do not customize `/etc/multipath.conf`. Because VDSM owns `/etc/multipath.conf`, installing or upgrading VDSM or {virt-product-fullname} can overwrite this file including any customizations it contains. This overwriting can cause severe storage failures.

Instead, you create a file in the `/etc/multipath/conf.d` directory that contains the settings you want to customize or override.

VDSM executes the files in `/etc/multipath/conf.d` in alphabetical order. So, to control the order of execution, you begin the filename with a number that makes it come last. For example, `/etc/multipath/conf.d/90-myfile.conf`.

To avoid causing severe storage failures, follow these guidelines:

* Do not modify `/etc/multipath.conf`. If the file contains user modifications, and the file is overwritten, it can cause unexpected storage problems.

* Do not override the `user_friendly_names` and `find_multipaths` settings. For details, see xref:ref-Recommended_Settings_for_Multipath_conf_SHE_cli_deploy[Recommended Settings for Multipath.conf].
* Avoid overriding the `no_path_retry` and `polling_interval` settings unless a storage vendor specifically requires you to do so. For details, see xref:ref-Recommended_Settings_for_Multipath_conf_SHE_cli_deploy[Recommended Settings for Multipath.conf].

[WARNING]
====
Not following these guidelines can cause catastrophic storage errors.
====

.Prerequisites

* VDSM is configured to use the multipath module. To verify this, enter:
+
```
# vdsm-tool is-configured --module multipath
```

.Procedure

. Create a new configuration file in the `/etc/multipath/conf.d` directory.

. Copy the individual setting you want to override from `/etc/multipath.conf` to the new configuration file in `/etc/multipath/conf.d/<my_device>.conf`. Remove any comment marks, edit the setting values, and save your changes.

. Apply the new configuration settings by entering:
+
```
# systemctl reload multipathd
```
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not restart the multipathd service. Doing so generates errors in the VDSM logs.
====

.Verification steps

. Test that the new configuration performs as expected on a non-production cluster in a variety of failure scenarios. For example, disable all of the storage connections.
. Enable one connection at a time and verify that doing so makes the storage domain reachable.
