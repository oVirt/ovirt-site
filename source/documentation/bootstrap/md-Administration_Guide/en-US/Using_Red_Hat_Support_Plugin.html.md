# Using Red Hat Support Plug-in

The Red Hat Access Plug-in allows you to use Red Hat access services from the Red Hat Virtualization Administration Portal. You must log in using your Red Hat login credentials. The Red Hat Access Plug-in detects when you are not logged in; if you are not logged in, a login window opens.

**Note:** Red Hat Virtualization Administration Portal credentials are not the same as a user's Red Hat login.
