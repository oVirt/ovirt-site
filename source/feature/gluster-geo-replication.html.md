# Gluster Geo Replication

## Summary

This feature allows the administrator to configure, start, stop and monitor geo-replication for Gluster volumes from oVirt engine. With this the administrator can view the status of geo-replication on Gluster volumes and also would be able to start/stop/configure geo-replication for a volume. GlusterFS geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous, and incremental replication service from one site to another over Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Network (WANs), and across the Internet.

To read more about GlusterFS geo-replication, see <http://gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_GlusterFS_Geo-replication_Deployment_Overview>.

## Current Status

*   Status: In Progress
*   Last updated date: Thu Jul 25 2013

## Detailed Description

GlusterFS Geo-replication uses a Source–Destination model, whereby replication and mirroring occurs between the following partners:

*   Source – A GlusterFS volume
*   Destination – A GlusterFS Volume in a remote cluster

With this feature the user will be able to

*   View all the destinations attached to a cluster
*   Add a new destination and enable password less communication between a host of source cluster and a host of destination cluster
*   Test password less communication to destination cluster/host
*   Remove(Detach) a destination cluster
*   View all active/inactive geo-replication sessions for a volume
*   Setup a new ge-replication session
*   Start a geo-replication session
*   Stop a geo-replication session
*   Remove an inactive geo-replication session
*   View and update the configuration before starting the session or later (ssh command, gsync command)
*   Monitor the status of geo-replication sessions in a cluster
