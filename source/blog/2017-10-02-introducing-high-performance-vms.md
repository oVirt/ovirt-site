#### What does it do?

Some of the magic includes:

- Enable Pass-Through Host CPU
- Enable IO Threads, Num Of IO Threads = 1
- Set the IO and Emulator threads pinning topology

For the full feature set, see the very detailed [High Performance VM feature page](/develop/release-management/features/virt/high-performance-vm/)

#### Count me in! How do I set it up?
Simple. Go to the **Administration Portal** and from the vertical menu select **Compute** > **Virtual machines**. Click the **New VM** tab to open up the New Virtual Machine dialog box. In the General tab next to the **Optimized for** field, click the drop down menu and select **High Performance**. Click **OK**. Depending on your current configurations, a smart pop-up may open with a list of additional recommended manual configurations, specific to your setup. To address these recommended changes, click **Cancel**.
