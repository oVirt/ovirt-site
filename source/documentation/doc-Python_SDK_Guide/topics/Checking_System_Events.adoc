[[Checking_System_Events]]
=== Checking System Events

{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} records and logs many system events. These event logs are accessible through the user interface, the system log files, and using the API. The `ovirtsdk` library exposes events using the `events` collection.

.Checking system events
====
In this example the `events` collection is listed.

The `query` parameter of the `list` method is used to ensure that all available pages of results are returned. By default the `list` method returns only the first page of results, which is `100` records in length.

The returned list is sorted in reverse chronological order, to display the events in the order in which they occurred.

import ovirtsdk4 as sdk
import ovirtsdk4.types as types

connection = sdk.Connection(
    url='https://engine.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='password',
    ca_file='ca.pem',
)

# Find the service that manages the collection of events:
events_service = connection.system_service().events_service()

page_number = 1
events = events_service.list(search='page %s' % page_number)
while events:
    for event in events:
        print(
            "%s %s CODE %s - %s" % (
                event.time,
                event.severity,
                event.code,
                event.description,
            )
        )
    page_number = page_number + 1
    events = events_service.list(search='page %s' % page_number)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()

These examples output events in the following format:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]

YYYY-MM-DD_T_HH:MM:SS NORMAL CODE 30 - User admin@internal logged in.
YYYY-MM-DD_T_HH:MM:SS NORMAL CODE 153 - VM vm1 was started by admin@internal (Host: MyHost).
YYYY-MM-DD_T_HH:MM:SS NORMAL CODE 30 - User admin@internal logged in.
