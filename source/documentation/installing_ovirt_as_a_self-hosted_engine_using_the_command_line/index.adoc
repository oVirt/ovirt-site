= Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a self-hosted engine using the command line

Self-hosted engine installation is automated using Ansible. The installation script (`hosted-engine --deploy`) runs on an initial deployment host, and the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} (or "engine") is installed and configured on a virtual machine that is created on the deployment host. The {engine-name} and Data Warehouse databases are installed on the {engine-name} virtual machine, but can be migrated to a separate server post-installation if required.

Hosts that can run the {engine-name} virtual machine are referred to as self-hosted engine nodes. At least two self-hosted engine nodes are required to support the high availability feature.

A storage domain dedicated to the {engine-name} virtual machine is referred to as the self-hosted engine storage domain. This storage domain is created by the installation script, so the underlying storage must be prepared before beginning the installation.

See the link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}html/planning_and_prerequisites_guide/[_Planning and Prerequisites Guide_] for information on environment options and recommended configuration. See link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}html-single/planning_and_prerequisites_guide/#self-hosted-engine-recommendations[Self-Hosted Engine Recommendations] for configuration specific to a self-hosted engine environment.

== Installation Overview

The self-hosted engine installation uses Ansible and the {engine-appliance-name} (a pre-configured {engine-name} virtual machine image) to automate the following tasks:

* Configuring the first self-hosted engine node
* Installing a {enterprise-linux} virtual machine on that node
* Installing and configuring the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} on that virtual machine
* Configuring the self-hosted engine storage domain

include::../common/install/snip-rhvm-appliance-note.adoc[]

Installing a self-hosted engine environment involves the following steps:

. xref:Preparing_Storage_for_RHV_SHE_cli_deploy[Prepare storage to use for the self-hosted engine storage domain and for standard storage domains.] You can use one of the following storage types:
* xref:Preparing_NFS_Storage_SHE_cli_deploy[NFS]
* xref:Preparing_iSCSI_Storage_SHE_cli_deploy[iSCSI]
* xref:Preparing_FCP_Storage_SHE_cli_deploy[Fibre Channel (FCP)]
* xref:Preparing_Red_Hat_Gluster_Storage_SHE_cli_deploy[{gluster-storage-fullname}]

. xref:Installing_the_self-hosted_engine_deployment_host_SHE_cli_deploy[Install a deployment host to run the installation on.] This host will become the first self-hosted engine node. You can use either host type:
* xref:Installing_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SHE_deployment_host[{hypervisor-fullname}]
* xref:Installing_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_Hosts_SHE_deployment_host[{enterprise-linux}]

. xref:Installing_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_SHE_cli_deploy[Install and configure the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}:]
.. xref:Deploying_the_Self-Hosted_Engine_Using_the_CLI_install_RHVM[Install the self-hosted engine using the `hosted-engine --deploy` command on the deployment host.]
.. xref:Enabling_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_Repositories_install_RHVM[Enable the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} repositories.]
.. xref:Connecting_to_the_Administration_Portal_install_RHVM[Connect to the Administration Portal to add hosts and storage domains.]

. xref:Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SHE_cli_deploy[Add more self-hosted engine nodes and standard hosts to the {engine-name}.] Self-hosted engine nodes can run the {engine-name} virtual machine and other virtual machines. Standard hosts can run all other virtual machines, but not the {engine-name} virtual machine.
.. Use either host type, or both:
* xref:Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SHE_cli_deploy[{hypervisor-fullname}]
* xref:Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_hosts_SHE_cli_deploy[{enterprise-linux}]
.. xref:Adding_self-hosted_engine_nodes_to_the_Manager_SHE_cli_deploy[Add hosts to the {engine-name} as self-hosted engine nodes.]
.. xref:Adding_standard_hosts_to_the_Manager_SHE_cli_deploy[Add hosts to the {engine-name} as standard hosts.]

. xref:Adding_Storage_Domains_to_RHV_SHE_cli_deploy[Add more storage domains to the {engine-name}.] The self-hosted engine storage domain is not recommended for use by anything other than the {engine-name} virtual machine.

. If you want to host any databases or services on a server separate from the {engine-name}, xref:Migrating_to_remote_servers_SHE_cli_deploy[you can migrate them after the installation is complete.]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keep the environment up to date. Since bug fixes for known issues are frequently released, use scheduled tasks to update the hosts and the {engine-name}.
