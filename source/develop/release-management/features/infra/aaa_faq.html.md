# AAA Frequently asked questions

## Is it possible to use specific Active Directory site?

Yes. It is possible since oVirt 3.6.
Let's say we have two Active Directory sites - one for Brno(called BRQ) and second for Tel Aviv(called TLV).
Now if we want to be sure to use only Active Directory servers from Brno site we need to append this to configuration:

```
pool.default.serverset.srvrecord.domain-conversion.type = regex
pool.default.serverset.srvrecord.domain-conversion.regex.pattern = ^(?<domain>.*)$
pool.default.serverset.srvrecord.domain-conversion.regex.replacement = BRQ._sites.${domain}
```

What these three magic lines does is, that instead of quering *_service._protocol.${domain}* SRV record, we query *_service._protocol.BRQ._sites.${domain}*.
In case of quering Global Catalog it's of course *_service._protocol.BRQ._sites.gc._msdcs.{forest}*.

Full [example](https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap.git;a=blob;f=examples/ad/aaa/profile1.properties;h=58345be1807759b69315df534ead7d1bdc1e8912;hb=HEAD#) configuration.

## Is it possible to use specific base DN instead of automatic resolution?

You can specify custom base DN, which overrides the one which is automatically resolved if
you add following lines into /etc/ovirt-engine/aaa/your_profile.properties:

```
sequence-init.init.100-my-basedn-init-vars = my-basedn-init
sequence.my-basedn-init.010.description = set custom baseDN
sequence.my-basedn-init.010.type = var-set
sequence.my-basedn-init.010.var-set.variable = simple_baseDN
sequence.my-basedn-init.010.var-set.value = dc=your,dc=different,dc=dn
```

## What's default connection/response timeout for LDAP? Can I change it?

Default connection timeout is 5 seconds.
Default response timeout is 60 seconds.

In order to change these, you need to change following configuration options:

```
# Values are in miliseconds
pool.default.connection-options.connectTimeoutMillis = 300
pool.default.connection-options.responseTimeoutMillis = 30000
```

## Is it possible to use forest trust in Active Directory setup?

It is not currently supported.

## Is it possible to use multi-domain Active Directory setup?

Yes, it's fully supported since oVirt 3.5. All domains are automatically resolved. User only need to specify Active Directory forest name.

## Is it possible to change default domain of multi-domain Active Directory setup?

Yes, you can configure it with aaa-misc extension. First you need to install it:

```
yum install -y ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-misc
```

Then create such *mapping* configuration, for example */etc/ovirt-engine/extensions.d/mapping.properties*

```
ovirt.engine.extension.name = mapping
ovirt.engine.extension.bindings.method = jbossmodule
ovirt.engine.extension.binding.jbossmodule.module = org.ovirt.engine-extensions.aaa.misc
ovirt.engine.extension.binding.jbossmodule.class = org.ovirt.engineextensions.aaa.misc.mapping.MappingExtension
ovirt.engine.extension.provides = org.ovirt.engine.api.extensions.aaa.Mapping
config.mapUser.type = regex
config.mapUser.regex.pattern = ^(?<user>[^@]*)$
config.mapUser.regex.replacement = ${user}@<default.suffix>
config.mapUser.regex.mustMatch = false
```

Replace *<default.suffix>* with the desired suffix, for example *${user}@subdomain.domain.com*.
Then apply above mapping into *authn* extension:

```
ovirt.engine.aaa.authn.mapping.plugin = mapping
```

Now, when you insert into login field user with username *joe* it will be mapped to *joe@subdomain.domain.com*.

## What's default Java Keystore password generated by aaa-ldap-setup? Can I change it?

Default password is *changeit*.

In order to change it run following command:

```
keytool -storepasswd -keystore /etc/ovirt-engine/aaa/profile_name.jks
```

Keytool will ask you for old password, which is *changeit* and then for new password.

## Is it possible to use client certificate authentication?

Yes, it's possible with *apache mod_ssl* module. Full blog post is available [here](http://machacekondra.blogspot.cz/2016/02/client-certificate-authentication-with.html).

## Is it possible to use CAS for authentication?

Yes, it's possible with *apache mod_auth_cas* module. Full blog post is available [here](/blog/2016/04/sso/).

## Is it possible to use SSSD for authentication?

Unfortunatelly it's not supported, yet. You can track [this](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=829292) bugzilla for more information.
