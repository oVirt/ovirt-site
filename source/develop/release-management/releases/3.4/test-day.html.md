# oVirt 3.4 Test Day

## Objective

*   engage project users and stakeholders to a hands-on experiences with oVirt new release.
*   improve the quality of oVirt.
*   Introduce and validating new oVirt 3.4 features
*   3rd test day will focus on complete installations and GA readiness using the RC release.

## What I should do

*   Specific tasks can be found in the 3_4-testday-3 tab of the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuAtmJW_VMCRdHJ6N1M3d1F1UTJTS1dSMnZwMF9XWVE&usp=sharing)
*   If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer information detail section below
*   Write down the configuration you used (HW, console, etc) and what you've tested in the [report etherpad](http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.4-testday-3) ([first test day report etherpad](http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.4-testday-1), [second test day report etherpad](http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.4-testday-2))
*   Go ahead and [install ovirt](/develop/release-management/releases/3.4/test-day/#installation-notes)
*   Follow the documentation to setup your environment, and test drive the new features.
*   Please remember we expect to see some issues, and anything you come up with will save a you when you'll install final release
*   Remember to try daily tasks you'd usually do in the engine, to see there are no regressions.
*   Accomplish the goals set in objective section , run the tests, update the test matrix.
*   Running into any issues?
    -   [Try to get help from the community](/community/) on #ovirt IRC channel or
    -   [open a bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt) ticket or
    -   Report it on the [report etherpad](http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.4-testday-3) ([first test day report etherpad](http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.4-testday-1), [second test day report etherpad](http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.4-testday-2))

## Installation notes

*   Make sure you have either a Fedora 19 or CentOS 6.5 machine installed.
*   Install the release pkg:

`sudo yum localinstall `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release.noarch.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release.noarch.rpm)
      sudo yum install yum-utils
      sudo yum-config-manager --enable ovirt-3.4.0-prerelease

(f19) you need to enable also fedora-virt-preview repo repository.

      sudo yum-config-manager --enable fedora-virt-preview

(el) you need to enable epel too

       sudo yum-config-manager --enable ovirt-epel
       sudo yum install epel-release
       if the above commands doesn't work you can install it manually:
` sudo yum install `[`http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm`](http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm)

*   follow [Install instructions in release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.4/)
*   guest agent rpms are available on <http://evilissimo.fedorapeople.org/repos/ovirt-guest-agent/ovirt-3.4/beta1/>
*   the following oVirt Node ISO (based on CentOS 6.5 and oVirt 3.4 components) can be used for the Test Day. **Important: If you run into problem first try to boot into SELinux permissive mode by appending enforcing=0 to the kernel when booting the ISO to prevent denials**

[`http://fedorapeople.org/~fabiand/node/3.0.4/ovirt-node-iso-3.0.4-1.0.201401291204.vdsm34.el6.iso`](http://fedorapeople.org/~fabiand/node/3.0.4/ovirt-node-iso-3.0.4-1.0.201401291204.vdsm34.el6.iso)

### Known issues

*   A Fedora 19 node goes to "non operational" state with the error "Host IPADDRESS is compatible with versions (3.0,3.1,3.2,3.3) and cannot join Cluster Default which is set to version 3.4.". The recommended fix is to enable the fedora-virt-preview repo, delivered with the ovirt-release , and to update libvirt from it. ()
*   Node
    -   Should work in enforcing mode, but might be booted into permissive mode to debug denials. Permissive: Append `enforcing=0` to the kernel on boot
*   Upgrade will fail if event_subscriber table is not empty Bug ()

## Regression testing

### General

You need at least two physical servers to install and configure a basic yet complete oVirt environment with shared storage to exercise the following:

### Network

*   Important Note: Known Fedora 19 bug: If the ovirtmgmt bridge is not successfully installed during initial host-setup, manually click on the host, setup networks, and add the ovirtmgmt bridge.
*   Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*   Advanced configurations:

![](/images/wiki/Vlan_bonding.png) Make sure each of the configs can:

*   Survive a reboot
*   Test network at both host and VM level
*   Ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*   Remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

### Tools

*   Basic operations on iso-uploader:

1.  **engine-iso-uploader list**
2.  **engine-iso-uploader upload <iso> -i <iso-domain-name> -v -f**

*   Basic operations on log-collector:

1.  **engine-log-collector list**
2.  **engine-log-collector collect**

*   Basic operation on image-uploader

**engine-image-uploader --name=<new name here> -e <domain> upload my.ovf**

#### New to v3.1:

*   port mirroring: one can setup a VM that sniffs all IP traffic between VMs on a network on a host.
*   no mac spoofing: VMs cannot emit packets with spoofed mac address (unless specifically allowed to).
*   Sync network: change network MTU (or other property) on host, verify that Engine may overwrite it with Sync network
*   Jumbo packets: see if can be configured and used by storage

#### New to v3.2:

*   Network main tab operational: you can search hosts and VM based on their network connectivity
*   Guest agent reported devices: install guest agent on a VM and see it report internal information of the vNics (internal device name, IPv4 and IPv6)
*   Network Linking: allow changing network the VM is connect to while it is running

### APIs

by default we'll be using the webadmin as our API for testing on this section we'll try to have default deployment with the different APIs
