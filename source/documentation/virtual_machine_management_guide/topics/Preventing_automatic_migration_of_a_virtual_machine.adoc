==== Preventing Automatic Migration of a Virtual Machine

{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} allows you to disable automatic migration of virtual machines. You can also disable manual migration of virtual machines by setting the virtual machine to run only on a specific host.

The ability to disable automatic migration and require a virtual machine to run on a particular host is useful when using application high availability products, such as Red Hat High Availability or Cluster Suite.


*Preventing Automatic Migration of Virtual Machines*

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines] and select a virtual machine.
. Click btn:[Edit].
. Click the *Host* tab.
. In the *Start Running On* section, select *Any Host in Cluster* or *Specific Host(s)*, which enables you to select multiple hosts.

[WARNING]
====
Explicitly assigning a virtual machine to a specific host and disabling migration are mutually exclusive with {virt-product-fullname} high availability. 
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the virtual machine has host devices directly attached to it, and a different host is specified, the host devices from the previous host will be automatically removed from the virtual machine.
