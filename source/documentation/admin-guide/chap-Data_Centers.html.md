# Chapter 4: Data Centers

## Introduction to Data Centers

A data center is a logical entity that defines the set of resources used in a specific environment. A data center is considered a container resource, in that it is comprised of logical resources, in the form of clusters and hosts; network resources, in the form of logical networks and physical NICs; and storage resources, in the form of storage domains.

A data center can contain multiple clusters, which can contain multiple hosts; it can have multiple storage domains associated to it; and it can support multiple virtual machines on each of its hosts. An oVirt environment can contain multiple data centers; the data center infrastructure allows you to keep these centers separate.

All data centers are managed from the single Administration Portal.

oVirt creates a default data center during installation. You can configure the default data center, or set up new appropriately named data centers.

## The Storage Pool Manager

The Storage Pool Manager (SPM) is a role given to one of the hosts in the data center enabling it to manage the storage domains of the data center. The SPM entity can be run on any host in the data center; the oVirt Engine grants the role to one of the hosts. The SPM does not preclude the host from its standard operation; a host running as SPM can still host virtual resources.

The SPM entity controls access to storage by coordinating the metadata across the storage domains. This includes creating, deleting, and manipulating virtual disks (images), snapshots, and templates, and allocating storage for sparse block devices (on SAN). This is an exclusive responsibility: only one host can be the SPM in the data center at one time to ensure metadata integrity.

The oVirt Engine ensures that the SPM is always available. The Manager moves the SPM role to a different host if the SPM host encounters problems accessing the storage. When the SPM starts, it ensures that it is the only host granted the role; therefore it will acquire a storage-centric lease. This process can take some time.

## SPM Priority

The SPM role uses some of a host's available resources. The SPM priority setting of a host alters the likelihood of the host being assigned the SPM role: a host with high SPM priority will be assigned the SPM role before a host with low SPM priority. Critical virtual machines on hosts with low SPM priority will not have to contend with SPM operations for host resources.

You can change a host's SPM priority by editing the host.

## Using the Events Tab to Identify Problem Objects in Data Centers

The **Events** tab for a data center displays all events associated with that data center; events include audits, warnings, and errors. The information displayed in the results list will enable you to identify problem objects in your oVirt environment.

The **Events** results list has two views: Basic and Advanced. Basic view displays the event icon, the time of the event, and the description of the events. Advanced view displays these also and includes, where applicable, the event ID; the associated user, host, virtual machine, template, data center, storage, and cluster; the Gluster volume, and the correlation ID.

## Data Center Tasks

### Creating a New Data Center

This procedure creates a data center in your virtualization environment. The data center requires a functioning cluster, host, and storage domain to operate.

**Note:** The storage **Type** can be edited until the first storage domain is added to the data center. Once a storage domain has been added, the storage **Type** cannot be changed.

Once the **Compatibility Version** is set, it cannot be lowered at a later time; version regression is not allowed.

**Creating a New Data Center**

1. Select the **Data Centers** resource tab to list all data centers in the results list.

2. Click **New** to open the **New Data Center** window.

3. Enter the **Name** and **Description** of the data center.

4. Select the storage **Type**, **Compatibility Version**, and **Quota Mode** of the data center from the drop-down menus.

5. Optionally, change the MAC address pool for the data center. The default MAC address pool is preselected by default. For more information on creating MAC address pools see [MAC Address Pools](sect-MAC_Address_Pools).

    1. Click the **MAC Address Pool** tab.

    2. Select the required MAC address pool from the **MAC Address Pool** drop-down list.

6. Click **OK** to create the data center and open the **New Data Center - Guide Me** window.

7. The **Guide Me** window lists the entities that need to be configured for the data center. Configure these entities or postpone configuration by clicking the **Configure Later** button; configuration can be resumed by selecting the data center and clicking the **Guide Me** button.

The new data center is added to the virtualization environment. It will remain **Uninitialized** until a cluster, host, and storage domain are configured for it; use **Guide Me** to configure these entities.

### Re-Initializing a Data Center: Recovery Procedure

This recovery procedure replaces the master data domain of your data center with a new master data domain; necessary in the event of data corruption of your master data domain. Re-initializing a data center allows you to restore all other resources associated with the data center, including clusters, hosts, and non-problematic storage domains.

You can import any backup or exported virtual machines or templates into your new master data domain.

**Re-Initializing a Data Center**

1. Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the data center to re-initialize.

2. Ensure that any storage domains attached to the data center are in maintenance mode.

3. Right-click the data center and select **Re-Initialize Data Center** from the drop-down menu to open the **Data Center Re-Initialize** window.

4. The **Data Center Re-Initialize** window lists all available (detached; in maintenance mode) storage domains. Click the radio button for the storage domain you are adding to the data center.

5. Select the **Approve operation** check box.

6. Click **OK** to close the window and re-initialize the data center.

The storage domain is attached to the data center as the master data domain and activated. You can now import any backup or exported virtual machines or templates into your new master data domain.

### Removing a Data Center

An active host is required to remove a data center. Removing a data center will not remove the associated resources.

**Removing a Data Center**

1. Ensure the storage domains attached to the data center is in maintenance mode.

2. Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the data center to remove.

3. Click **Remove** to open the **Remove Data Center(s)** confirmation window.

4. Click **OK**.

### Force Removing a Data Center

A data center becomes `Non Responsive` if the attached storage domain is corrupt or if the host becomes `Non Responsive`. You cannot **Remove** the data center under either circumstance.

**Force Remove** does not require an active host. It also permanently removes the attached storage domain.

It may be necessary to **Destroy** a corrupted storage domain before you can **Force Remove** the data center.

**Force Removing a Data Center**

1. Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the data center to remove.

2. Click **Force Remove** to open the **Force Remove Data Center** confirmation window.

3. Select the **Approve operation** check box.

4. Click **OK**

The data center and attached storage domain are permanently removed from the oVirt environment.

### Changing the Data Center Compatibility Version

oVirt data centers have a compatibility version. The compatibility version indicates the version of oVirt that the data center is intended to be compatible with. All clusters in the data center must support the desired compatibility level.

**Note:** To change the data center compatibility version, you must have first updated all the clusters in your data center to a level that supports your desired compatibility level.

**Changing the Data Center Compatibility Version**

1. From the Administration Portal, click the **Data Centers** tab.

2. Select the data center to change from the list displayed.

3. Click **Edit**.

4. Change the **Compatibility Version** to the desired value.

5. Click **OK** to open the **Change Data Center Compatibility Version** confirmation window.

6. Click **OK** to confirm.

You have updated the compatibility version of the data center.

**Important:** Upgrading the compatibility will also upgrade all of the storage domains belonging to the data center.

## Data Centers and Storage Domains

### Attaching an Existing Data Domain to a Data Center

Data domains that are **Unattached** can be attached to a data center. Shared storage domains of multiple types (iSCSI, NFS, FC, POSIX, and Gluster) can be added to the same data center.

**Attaching an Existing Data Domain to a Data Center**

1. Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the appropriate data center.

2. Select the **Storage** tab in the details pane to list the storage domains already attached to the data center.

3. Click **Attach Data** to open the **Attach Storage** window.

4. Select the check box for the data domain to attach to the data center. You can select multiple check boxes to attach multiple data domains.

5. Click **OK**.

The data domain is attached to the data center and is automatically activated.

### Attaching an Existing ISO domain to a Data Center

An ISO domain that is **Unattached** can be attached to a data center. The ISO domain must be of the same **Storage Type** as the data center.

Only one ISO domain can be attached to a data center.

**Attaching an Existing ISO Domain to a Data Center**

1. Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the appropriate data center.

2. Select the **Storage** tab in the details pane to list the storage domains already attached to the data center.

3. Click **Attach ISO** to open the **Attach ISO Library** window.

4. Click the radio button for the appropriate ISO domain.

5. Click **OK**.

The ISO domain is attached to the data center and is automatically activated.

### Attaching an Existing Export Domain to a Data Center

**Note:** The export storage domain is deprecated. Storage data domains can be unattached from a data center and imported to another data center in the same environment, or in a different environment. Virtual machines, floating virtual disk images, and templates can then be uploaded from the imported storage domain to the attached data center. See [Importing Existing Storage Domains](sect-Importing_Existing_Storage_Domains) for information on importing storage domains.

An export domain that is **Unattached** can be attached to a data center. Only one export domain can be attached to a data center.

**Attaching an Existing Export Domain to a Data Center**

1. Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the appropriate data center.

2. Select the **Storage** tab in the details pane to list the storage domains already attached to the data center.

3. Click **Attach Export** to open the **Attach Export Domain** window.

4. Click the radio button for the appropriate Export domain.

5. Click **OK**.

The export domain is attached to the data center and is automatically activated.

### Detaching a Storage Domain from a Data Center

Detaching a storage domain from a data center will stop the data center from associating with that storage domain. The storage domain is not removed from the oVirt environment; it can be attached to another data center.

Data, such as virtual machines and templates, remains attached to the storage domain.

**Note:** The master storage, if it is the last available storage domain, cannot be removed.

**Detaching a Storage Domain from a Data Center**

1. Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the appropriate data center.

2. Select the **Storage** tab in the details pane to list the storage domains attached to the data center.

3. Select the storage domain to detach. If the storage domain is `Active`, click **Maintenance** to open the **Maintenance Storage Domain(s)** confirmation window.

4. Click **OK** to initiate maintenance mode.

5. Click **Detach** to open the **Detach Storage** confirmation window.

6. Click **OK**.

You have detached the storage domain from the data center. It can take up to several minutes for the storage domain to disappear from the details pane.

## Data Centers and Permissions

### Managing System Permissions for a Data Center

As the **SuperUser**, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a **DataCenterAdmin** role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a **ClusterAdmin** has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.

A data center administrator is a system administration role for a specific data center only. This is useful in virtualization environments with multiple data centers where each data center requires an administrator. The **DataCenterAdmin** role is a hierarchical model; a user assigned the data center administrator role for a data center can manage all objects in the data center with the exception of storage for that data center. Use the **Configure** button in the header bar to assign a data center administrator for all data centers in the environment.

The data center administrator role permits the following actions:

* Create and remove clusters associated with the data center.

* Add and remove hosts, virtual machines, and pools associated with the data center.

* Edit user permissions for virtual machines associated with the data center.

**Note:** You can only assign roles and permissions to existing users.

You can change the system administrator of a data center by removing the existing system administrator and adding the new system administrator.

### Data Center Administrator Roles Explained

**Data Center Permission Roles**

The table below describes the administrator roles and privileges applicable to data center administration.

**oVirt System Administrator Roles**

| Role | Privileges | Notes |
|-
| DataCenterAdmin | Data Center Administrator | Can use, create, delete, manage all physical and virtual resources within a specific data center except for storage, including clusters, hosts, templates and virtual machines. |
| NetworkAdmin | Network Administrator | Can configure and manage the network of a particular data center. A network administrator of a data center inherits network permissions for virtual machines within the data center as well. |

### Assigning an Administrator or User Role to a Resource

Assign administrator or user roles to resources to allow users to access or manage that resource.

**Assigning a Role to a Resource**

1. Use the resource tabs, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the resource in the results list.
