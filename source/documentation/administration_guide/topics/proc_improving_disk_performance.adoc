= Improving disk performance

In the Administration Portal, on the virtual machine's *Resource Allocation* tab, the default *I/O Threads Enabled* setting is checked (enabled), and the number of threads is `1`.

Suppose a virtual machine has multiple disks that have VirtIO controllers, and its workloads make significant use of those controllers. In that case, you can improve performance by increasing the number of I/O threads.

However, also consider that increasing the number of I/O threads decreases the virtual machine's pool of threads. If your workloads do not use the VirtIO controllers and the threads you allocate to them, increasing the number of I/O threads might decrease overall performance.

To find the optimal number of threads, benchmark the performance of your virtual machine running workloads before and after you adjust the number of threads.

.Procedure

. On menu:Compute[Virtual Machines], *Power Off* the virtual machine.
. Click the name of the virtual machine.
. In the details pane, click the *Vm Devices* tab.
. Count the number of controllers whose *Type* is `virtio` or `virtio-scsi`.
. Click btn:[Edit].
. In the *Edit Virtual Machine* window, click the *Resource Allocation* tab.
. Confirm that *I/O Threads Enabled* is checked (enabled).
. To the right of *I/O Threads Enabled*, increase the number of threads, but do not exceed number of controllers whose type is `virtio` or `virtio-scsi`.
. Click btn:[OK].
. In the details pane, click the *Disks* tab.
. For each disk, use *More Actions* (image:common/images/moreactions.png[Title="More Actions menu"]) to *Deactivate* and *Activate* the disk. This action remaps the disks to the controllers.
. Click btn:[Run] to start the virtual machine.

.Verification steps

* To see which controllers have an I/O thread, click *Vm Devices* in the details pane and look for `ioThreadid=` in the *Spec Params* column.
* To see the mapping of disks to controllers, log into the host machine and enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# virsh -r dumpxml virtual_machine_name
----
