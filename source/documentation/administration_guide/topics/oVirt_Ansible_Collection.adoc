=== oVirt Ansible Collection

*oVirt Ansible Collection* provides modules, roles, and plugins for managing various parts of the Red Hat Virtualization infrastructure.
The modules are used for communication between Ansible and the Red Hat Virtualization Manager.
Ansible roles provide a method of modularizing Ansible code by breaking up large playbooks into smaller reusable files that can be shared with other users.
