==== Installing Windows on VirtIO-optimized hardware

Install VirtIO-optimized disk and network device drivers during your Windows installation by attaching the `virtio-win___version__.iso` file to your virtual machine. These drivers provide a performance improvement over emulated device drivers.

Use the *Run Once* option to attach the `virtio-win___version__.iso` file in a one-off boot different from the *Boot Options* defined in the *New Virtual Machine* window.

.Prerequisites

The following items have been added to the virtual machine:

* a *Red Hat VirtIO* network interface.
* a disk that uses the *VirtIO* interface. This disk can be on a

You can upload `virtio-win___version__.iso` to a data storage domain.

[NOTE]
====
{org-fullname} recommends uploading ISO images to the data domain with the Administration Portal or with the REST API. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}administration_guide[Uploading Images to a Data Storage Domain] in the _Administration Guide_.

If necessary, you can upload the `virtio-win` ISO file to an ISO storage domain that is hosted on the {engine-name}. The ISO storage domain type is deprecated. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}administration_guide/index.html#Copy_ISO_to_ISO_domain-storage_tasks[Uploading images to an ISO domain] in the _Administration Guide_.
