[[Viewing_Storage_Health_Status]]
==== Viewing the Health Status of a Storage Domain

Storage domains have an external health status in addition to their regular *Status*. The external health status is reported by plug-ins or external systems, or set by an administrator, and appears to the left of the storage domain's *Name* as one of the following icons:

* *OK*: No icon

* *Info*: image:images/Info.png[]

* *Warning*: image:images/Warning.png[]

* *Error*: image:images/Error.png[]

* *Failure*: image:images/Failure.png[]

To view further details about the storage domain's health status, click the storage domain's name. This opens the details view, and click the *Events* tab.

The storage domain's health status can also be viewed using the REST API. A `GET` request on a storage domain will include the `external_status` element, which contains the health status.

You can set a storage domain's health status in the REST API via the `events` collection. For more information, see link:http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-engine-api-model/4.4/#services[Adding Events] in the _REST API Guide_.
