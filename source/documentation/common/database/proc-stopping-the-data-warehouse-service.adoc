.Procedure

. Stop the Data Warehouse service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl stop ovirt-engine-dwhd.service
----
+
. If the database is hosted on a remote machine, you must manually grant access by editing the postgres.conf file. Edit the [filename]`/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf` file and modify the listen_addresses line so that it matches the following:

listen_addresses = '*'
----
If the line does not exist or has been commented out, add it manually.
+
If the database is hosted on the {engine-name} machine and was configured during a clean setup of the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}, access is granted by default.

. Restart the postgresql service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl restart postgresql
