==== Adding Multiple VLANs to a Single Network Interface Using Logical Networks

Multiple VLANs can be added to a single network interface to separate traffic on the one host.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have created more than one logical network, all with the *Enable VLAN tagging* check box selected in the *New Logical Network* or *Edit Logical Network* windows.

*Adding Multiple VLANs to a Network Interface using Logical Networks*

. Click menu:Compute[Hosts].
. Click the host's name. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Network Interfaces* tab.
. Click *Setup Host Networks*.
. Drag your VLAN-tagged logical networks into the *Assigned Logical Networks* area next to the physical network interface. The physical network interface can have multiple logical networks assigned due to the VLAN tagging.
. Edit the logical networks:
.. Hover your cursor over an assigned logical network and click the pencil icon.
.. If your logical network definition is not synchronized with the network configuration on the host, select the *Sync network* check box.
.. Select a *Boot Protocol*:
* *None*
* *DHCP*
* *Static*
.. Provide the *IP* and *Subnet Mask*.
.. Click btn:[OK].
. Select the *Verify connectivity between Host and Engine* check box to run a network check; this will only work if the host is in maintenance mode.
. Click btn:[OK].

Add the logical network to each host in the cluster by editing a NIC on each host in the cluster. After this is done, the network will become operational.

This process can be repeated multiple times, selecting and editing the same network interface each time on each host to add logical networks with different VLAN tags to a single network interface.
