[[Adding_OVN_as_an_External_Network_Provider]]
==== Adding Open Virtual Network (OVN) as an External Network Provider

You can use Open Virtual Network (OVN) to create overlay virtual networks that enable communication among the virtual machines without adding VLANs or changing the infrastructure. OVN is an extension of Open vSwitch (OVS) that provides native support for virtual L2 and L3 overlays.

You can xref:Installing_a_new_OVN_network_provider[install a new OVN network provider] or xref:Adding_an_existing_OVN_network_provider[add an existing one].

You can also connect an OVN network to a native {virt-product-fullname} network. See xref:Connecting_an_OVN_Network_to_a_Physical_Network[] for more information.

The `ovirt-provider-ovn` exposes a Neutron-like REST API. You can use this API to create networks, subnets, ports, and routers. For details, see link:https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/network/v2/[_OpenStack Networking API v2.0_].

// [NOTE]
// ====
// CloudForms supports OVN as an external provider using the OpenStack (Neutron) API. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/managing_providers/network_providers[Network Managers] in _Red Hat CloudForms: Managing Providers_ for details.
