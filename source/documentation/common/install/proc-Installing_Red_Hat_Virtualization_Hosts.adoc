= Installing {hypervisor-fullname}s

{hypervisor-fullname} ({hypervisor-shortname}) is a minimal operating system based on {enterprise-linux} that is designed to provide a simple method for setting up a physical machine to act as a hypervisor in a {virt-product-fullname} environment. The minimal operating system contains only the packages required for the machine to act as a hypervisor, and features a Cockpit web interface for monitoring the host and performing administrative tasks. See link:http://cockpit-project.org/running.html[] for the minimum browser requirements.

{hypervisor-shortname} supports NIST 800-53 partitioning requirements to improve security. {hypervisor-shortname} uses a NIST 800-53 partition layout by default.

The host must meet the minimum  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4/html/planning_and_prerequisites_guide/rhv_requirements#host-requirements[host requirements].
