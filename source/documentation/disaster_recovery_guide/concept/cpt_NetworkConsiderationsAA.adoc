==== Network Considerations

All hosts in the cluster must be on the same broadcast domain over an L2 network. This means that connectivity between the two sites needs to be L2.

The maximum latency requirements between the sites across the L2 network differs for the two setups. The standalone {engine-name} environment requires a maximum latency of 100ms, while the self-hosted engine environment requires a maximum latency of 7ms.
