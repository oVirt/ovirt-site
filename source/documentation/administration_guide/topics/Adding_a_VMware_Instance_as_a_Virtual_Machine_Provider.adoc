==== Adding a VMware Instance as a Virtual Machine Provider

Add a VMware vCenter instance to import virtual machines from VMware to the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}.

{virt-product-fullname} uses V2V to convert VMware virtual machines to the correct format before they are imported. The `virt-v2v` package must be installed on at least one host. The `virt-v2v` package is available by default on {hypervisor-fullname}s ({hypervisor-shortname}) and is installed on {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s as a dependency of VDSM when added to the {virt-product-fullname} environment. {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s must be {enterprise-linux} 7.2 or later.

[NOTE]
====
The `virt-v2v` package is not available on ppc64le architecture; these hosts cannot be used as proxy hosts.

*Adding a VMware vCenter Instance as a Virtual Machine Provider*

. Click menu:Administration[Providers].
. Click *Add*.
. Enter a *Name* and *Description*.
. Select *VMware* from the *Type* drop-down list.
. Select the *Data Center* into which VMware virtual machines will be imported, or select *Any Data Center* to instead specify the destination data center during individual import operations.
. Enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name of the VMware vCenter instance in the *vCenter* field.
. Enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name of the host from which the virtual machines will be imported in the *ESXi* field.
. Enter the name of the data center in which the specified ESXi host resides in the *Data Center* field.
. If you have exchanged the SSL certificate between the ESXi host and the {engine-name}, leave the *Verify server's SSL certificate* check box selected to verify the ESXi host's certificate. If not, clear the check box.
. Select a host in the chosen data center with `virt-v2v` installed to serve as the *Proxy Host* during virtual machine import operations. This host must also be able to connect to the network of the VMware vCenter external provider. If you selected *Any Data Center* above, you cannot choose the host here, but instead can specify a host during individual import operations.
. Enter the *Username* and *Password* for the VMware vCenter instance. The user must have access to the VMware data center and ESXi host on which the virtual machines reside.
. Test the credentials:
.. Click *Test* to test whether you can authenticate successfully with the VMware vCenter instance using the provided credentials.
.. If the VMware vCenter instance uses SSL, the *Import provider certificates* window opens; click *OK* to import the certificate that the VMware vCenter instance provides to ensure the {engine-name} can communicate with the instance.
. Click *OK*.
