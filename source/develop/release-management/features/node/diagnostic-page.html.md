## Detailed Description

A diagnostic TUI page where output from commands (currently: fdisk -l, parted -l, multipath -ll) can be viewed without going to the shell. Addition of scrollbars to TableWidgets in the TUI, and creation of a new ScrollBox TUI class.

## Benefit to oVirt

Reduction in need to leave the TUI to diagnose problems. The ScrollBox and scrollbar abrogate the need to suspend the UI to display long output from commands, and give the user an indication of length.
