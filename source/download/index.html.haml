    # oVirt Deployment Options

    The preferred way to install oVirt is by using your operating system's package manager.

    {:.alert.alert-warning}
    If you are new to oVirt and would like an easy way to try oVirt, download our [Live version](/download/ovirt-live/) where you can use oVirt on CentOS without installing it on your machine.

    [See the oVirt Quickstart Guide for quick start information](/documentation/quickstart)

  ## Install oVirt using package manager

  **oVirt 4.1** is intended for production use and is available for the following platforms:

  - Fedora 24
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 or later
  - CentOS Linux 7.3 or later
  - Scientific Linux 7.3 or later

  Our recommended method of installing oVirt is to use the pre-built packages for Fedora or a supported Enterprise Linux 7 distribution,
  such as CentOS Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This makes installing oVirt very easy.

  {:.alert.alert-warning.col-md-6}
  **Important:** If you're upgrading from a previous version, please update ovirt-release40 and verify
  you have the correct repositories enabled by running the following commands before upgrading with the usual procedure.
  <br/>
  ```
  # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm
  ```
  <br/><br/>
  You should also read the [Release Notes for oVirt 4.1.2.](/release/4.1.2/)

  ### Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS {#Fedora_RHEL_Installation_Instructions}

  {:.alert.alert-warning.col-md-6}
  If you're using RHEL or CentOS, substitite "dnf" with its older counterpart, "yum".

.clear-left

:markdown

  1.  Add the official oVirt repository.

          sudo dnf install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm

      -   This will add repositories from ovirt.org to your host allowing you to get the latest oVirt rpms.
      -   It will also enable any other needed repository including for example [virt-preview](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Virtualization_Preview_Repository) repository on your machine giving you access to the latest versions of things like libvirt and KVM.

  2.  Install oVirt Engine.

          sudo dnf install -y ovirt-engine

  3.  Set up oVirt Engine.

          sudo engine-setup

  4.  Follow the on screen prompts to configure and install the engine
  5.  Once you have successfully installed oVirt Engine, you will be provided with instructions to access oVirt's web-based management interface.
  6.  Congratulations! oVirt Engine is now installed!

  {:.alert.alert-warning}
  Experienced users can also compile from source, using the guides for the [oVirt Engine](/develop/developer-guide/engine/engine-development-environment/) and [oVirt Node](/develop/projects/node/building/).
:markdown
  ## Install Hosts

  oVirt Engine manages Hosts, and Hosts are where virtual machines run. Now that oVirt Engine is installed, you must install at least
  one Host to have a fully functional environment.

  You can use either [oVirt Node](/node/), Fedora, or CentOS as Hosts.

:markdown
  ## Supported Guest Distributions

  Once oVirt is running and you have configured a Host, you can proceed to install any number of supported operating systems as guest virtual machines.

  ## GPG Keys used by oVirt

  **Important:** We are going to sign RPMs only from next release. Please wait for the announcement email

  How does oVirt Project use GPG keys to sign packages? Each stable RPM package that is published by oVirt Project is signed with a GPG signature. By default, yum and the graphical update tools will verify these signatures and refuse to install any packages that are not signed or have bad signatures. You should always verify the signature of a package before you install it. These signatures ensure that the packages you install are what was produced by the oVirt Project and have not been altered (accidentally or maliciously) by any mirror or website that is providing the packages. Nightly repositories wont be signed.

  ### Importing Keys Manually

  For some repositories, such as repositories with stable in default configuration, yum is able to find a proper key for the repository and asks the user for confirmation before importing the key if the key is not already imported into the rpm database.

  To get the public key:

      $ gpg --recv-keys FE590CB7
      $ gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint FE590CB7
      ---
      pub   2048R/FE590CB7 2014-03-30 [expires: 2021-04-03]
            Key fingerprint = 31A5 D783 7FAD 7CB2 86CD  3469 AB8C 4F9D FE59 0CB7
      uid                  oVirt <infra@ovirt.org>
      sub   2048R/004BC303 2014-03-30 [expires: 2021-04-03]
      ---
      $ gpg --export --armor FE590CB7 > ovirt-infra.pub
      # rpm --import ovirt-infra.pub

  Importing keys Automatically

      yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm

  **Important:** yum will prompt sysadmin to acknowledge import of key, make sure key id is FE590CB7.

  ### Verifying a package

  When using default configuration of yum package updating and installation tool in stable releases, signature of each package is verified before it is installed. Signature verification can be turned off and on globally or for specific repository with gpgcheck directive. Do not override the default setting of this directive unless you have a very good reason to do so. If you do not use yum, you can check the signature of the package using the following command

      rpm {-K|--checksig} PACKAGE_FILE ...

  ### Currently used keys

  | Key ID     | Key Type     | Key Fingerprint                                     | Key Description | Created    | Expires    | Revoked | Notes |
  |------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|------------|---------|-------|
  | `FE590CB7` | 2048-bit RSA | `31A5 D783 7FAD 7CB2 86CD 3469 AB8C 4F9D FE59 0CB7` | oVirt           | 2014-03-30 | 2021-04-03 |         |       |
