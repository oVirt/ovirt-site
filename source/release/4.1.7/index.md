# oVirt 4.1.7 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.1.7
release as of November 7, 2017.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4,
CentOS Linux 7.4 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.1.7, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## What's New in 4.1.7?

### Enhancements

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1490810](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1490810) <b>print task list to log in TooManyTasks issue</b><br>Previously, while VDSM performed periodic monitoring and maintenance tasks, operations would occasionally become too slow or even become blocked. In this case, the internal queue became full and the periodic operations were no longer performed. A "TooManyTasks" warning  appeared in the log files at a maximum rate of once every 10 seconds.<br><br>In this release, if VDSM cannot perform its periodic operations, in addition to issuing a warning in the log files, VDSM also dumps the contents of the queue into the logs.

#### oVirt Engine Metrics

 - [BZ 1502931](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1502931) <b>[RFE]  Allow passing extra ansible opts to oVirt Metrics shell script</b><br>

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1502510](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1502510) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.7] Rest API does not report network statistics host "data.current.tx, data.current.rx"</b><br>The precision of rx_rate, tx_rate, rx_drop, and tx_drop of virtual and host network interfaces have been increased. Network traffic 100 times smaller can now be detected on network interface statistics.<br><br>If traffic on the network interface is below the precision of the network interface statistics, it is not reflected in the statistics.

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1471658](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1471658) <b>[HC] Hosted engine deployment should enable gfapi access for cluster</b><br>Feature: Enabling gfapi during HE installation<br><br>Reason: For the HC deployment, we want the gfapi access to be enabled for the "Default" cluster during HE deployment. <br><br>Result: You could use additional config file with:<br><br>OVEHOSTED_ENGINE/enableLibgfapi=bool:True<br><br>to enable libgfapi during HE setup

#### oVirt Hosted Engine HA

 - [BZ 1502653](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1502653) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.7] HE host on EngineStarting -> EngineMaybeAway -> EngineDown cycle</b><br>This release adds caching of the OVF storage location. As the OVF storage location rarely changes, it does not need to be searched for on every monitoring loop iteration. Instead it can be saved and reused, and expired only in the case of an error. As a result, the monitoring loop execution time is decreased significantly.

### Rebase: Bug Fixeses and Enhancementss

#### oVirt Host

 - [BZ 1503124](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1503124) <b>Provide ovirt-host package in 4.1</b><br>A new package ovirt-host is introduced. It is required for a host to be added to a 4.2 engine.
