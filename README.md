## How to contribute
Please join us! All content on ovirt.org is community-driven, and we welcome contributions!

## Found a bug or documentation issue?
To submit a bug or suggest a documentation fix/enhancement for a specific page, navigate to the page, and click "Report an issue on GitHub" in the page footer. If it is a more general problem, simply [submit an issue here](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/issues/new) and provide as much detail as possible.

## Edit the site
To edit a single page, navigate to the page, and click "Edit this page on GitHub" in the page footer. That will create a simple Pull Request where you can propose your changes.

You can also clone and fork the repository like any other GitHub project, if you are more comfortable with that. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on building and testing the site locally.

See [MAINTAINING.md](MAINTAINING.md) for information about site maintainers.

See [README_ORGANIZATION.md](README_ORGANIZATION.md) for information about how the source code is organized.

All content in the website is written in Markdown. For information on formatting Markdown, see [Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/).

You can create a new file two ways:

- From your local Git repo folder, navigate to the relevant directory, create a new text file and save it with the following naming convention: `<name>.md`

- From the GitHub repo, navigate to the relevant directory and click the New File button at the top-right corner of the pane.
