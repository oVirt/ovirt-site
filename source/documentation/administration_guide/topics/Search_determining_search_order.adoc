=== Search: Determining Search Order

You can determine the sort order of the returned information by using `sortby`. Sort direction (`asc` for ascending, `desc` for descending) can be included.

For example:

`events: severity > normal sortby time desc`

This query returns all Events whose severity is higher than Normal, sorted by time (descending order).
