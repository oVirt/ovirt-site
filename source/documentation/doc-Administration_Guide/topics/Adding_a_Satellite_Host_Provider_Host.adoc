==== Adding a Satellite Host Provider Host

The process for adding a Satellite host provider host is almost identical to that of adding a {enterprise-linux-host-fullname} except for the method by which the host is identified in the {engine-name}. The following procedure outlines how to add a host provided by a Satellite host provider.

*Adding a Satellite Host Provider Host*

. Click menu:Compute[Hosts].
. Click *New*.
. Use the drop-down menu to select the *Host Cluster* for the new host.
. Select the *Foreman/Satellite* check box to display the options for adding a Satellite host provider host and select the provider from which the host is to be added.
. Select either *Discovered Hosts* or *Provisioned Hosts*.
* *Discovered Hosts* (default option): Select the host, host group, and compute resources from the drop-down lists.
* *Provisioned Hosts*: Select a host from the *Providers Hosts* drop-down list.
+
Any details regarding the host that can be retrieved from the external provider are automatically set, and can be edited as desired.
. Enter the *Name* and *SSH Port* (Provisioned Hosts only) of the new host.
. Select an authentication method to use with the host.
* Enter the root user's password to use password authentication.
* Copy the key displayed in the *SSH PublicKey* field to */root/.ssh/authorized_hosts* on the host to use public key authentication (Provisioned Hosts only).
. You have now completed the mandatory steps to add a {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}. Click the *Advanced Parameters* drop-down button to show the advanced host settings.
.. Optionally disable automatic firewall configuration.
.. Optionally add a host SSH fingerprint to increase security. You can add it manually, or fetch it automatically.
. You can configure the *Power Management*, *SPM*, *Console*, and *Network Provider* using the applicable tabs now; however, as these are not fundamental to adding a {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}, they are not covered in this procedure.
. Click btn:[OK] to add the host and close the window.

The new host displays in the list of hosts with a status of `Installing`, and you can view the progress of the installation in the details view. After installation is complete, the status will update to `Reboot`. The host must be activated for the status to change to `Up`.
