# oVirt 4.4.6 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.6 Third Release Candidate as of April 08, 2021.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 and
CentOS Linux 8.3 (or similar).

visit our [community page](/community/).
All issues or bugs should be reported via
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).

The oVirt Project makes no guarantees as to its suitability or usefulness.
This pre-release should not to be used in production, and it is not feature
complete.

## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.6 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.6 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.6).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.6?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1933974](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1933974) **[RFE] Introduce Datacenter and cluster level 4.6**

   DataCenter and Cluster compatibility level 4.6 is introduced in oVirt Engine 4.4.6. Only hosts running on CentOS/RHEL 8.4 with Advanced Virtualization 8.4 (libvirt &gt;= 7.0.0) can join cluster level 4.6.



New features available in compatibility 4.6 are tracked as separate bugs depending on this bug.


#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1933974](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1933974) **[RFE] Introduce Datacenter and cluster level 4.6**

   DataCenter and Cluster compatibility level 4.6 is introduced in oVirt Engine 4.4.6. Only hosts running on CentOS/RHEL 8.4 with Advanced Virtualization 8.4 (libvirt &gt;= 7.0.0) can join cluster level 4.6.



New features available in compatibility 4.6 are tracked as separate bugs depending on this bug.


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1669178](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1669178) **[RFE] Q35 SecureBoot - Add ability to preserve variable store certificates.**

   Secure Boot process relies on keys that are normally stored in NVRAM of the VM. However, NVRAM was not stored in previous versions of oVirt and was newly initialized on every start of a VM. This prevented the use of any custom drivers (e.g. for Nvidia devices or for PLDP drivers in SUSE) on VMs with Secure Boot enabled. To be able to use SecureBoot VMs effectively oVirt now persists the content of NVRAM for UEFI VMs.

 - [BZ 1936897](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1936897) **[Engine JDK 11] More verbose and configurable GC logging.**

   Feature: 

More verbose and configurable GC logging. This includes:

1. GC verbose logging disabled by default with INFO verbosity level.



2. Ability to setup desired GC log level via config the property:

ENGINE_VERBOSE_GC_LOG_LEVEL=info

Available options are: off, error, warning, info, debug, trace



3. Ability to setup desired GC log file rotation via:

ENGINE_VERBOSE_GC_LOG_FILE_SIZE=2M  #single log file size

ENGINE_VERBOSE_GC_LOG_FILES_NUMBER=50 #number of files in rotation



Reason: 

oVirt Engine tends to allocate large chunks of memory (depending on overall setup) that might contribute to potential various slow downs caused by Java Garbage Collector operations. 



Result: 

The ability to monitor and discover memory related issues much earlier (before the issue is actually negatively impacting an environment)





In order to customize or disable the above default settings it is recommended to put these properties in one of the engine's etc config ie. /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/99-setup-gc-logging.conf
