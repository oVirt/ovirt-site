### Current status

*   Last updated date: TBD

### Detailed Description

*   Original proposal: [Project Proposal - MOM](/develop/projects/mom.html)
*   Policy handling: [Sla/host-mom-policy](/develop/sla/host-mom-policy.html)

<!-- -->

*   Integration steps:

      - Complete code integration in VDSM
      - MOM packages (nightlies and releases) need to be built by Jenkins
      - VDSM RPM should require MOM rpm
      - ksmtuned should be disabled on hosts because it conflicts with mom ksm tuning

### Benefit to oVirt

This is the foundation of SLA @oVirt, allowing enforcement of various aspects such as limitations and reservations in host level.
