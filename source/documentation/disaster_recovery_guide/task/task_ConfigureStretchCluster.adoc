=== Configure a Self-hosted Engine Stretch Cluster Environment

This procedure provides instructions to configure a stretch cluster using a self-hosted engine deployment.

include::{cptdir}/cpt_StretchPrerequisites.adoc[]

*Limitations*:

* Maximum 7ms latency between sites.

*Configuring the Self-hosted Engine Stretch Cluster*

. Deploy the self-hosted engine. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_cockpit_web_interface[_Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a self-hosted engine using the Cockpit web interface_].

. Install additional self-hosted engine nodes in each site and add them to your cluster. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_cockpit_web_interface/#Adding_self-hosted_engine_nodes_to_the_Manager_SHE_cockpit_deploy[Adding Self-hosted Engine Nodes to the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}] in _Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a self-hosted engine using the Cockpit web interface_.

. Optionally, install additional standard hosts. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_cockpit_web_interface/#Adding_standard_hosts_to_the_Manager_SHE_cockpit_deploy[Adding Standard Hosts to the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}] in _Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a self-hosted engine using the Cockpit web interface_.

=== Configure a Standalone {engine-name} Stretch Cluster Environment

This procedure provides instructions to configure a stretch cluster using a standalone {engine-name} deployment.

include::{cptdir}/cpt_StretchPrerequisites.adoc[]

*Limitations*:

* Maximum 100ms latency between sites.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {engine-name} must be highly available for virtual machines to failover and failback between sites. If the {engine-name} goes down with the site, the virtual machines will not failover.

The standalone {engine-name} is only highly available when managed externally. For example:

* Using Red Hat’s High Availability Add-On.
* As a highly available virtual machine in a separate virtualization environment.
* Using {enterprise-linux} Cluster Suite.
* In a public cloud.
====

*Configuring the Standalone {engine-name} Stretch Cluster*

. Install and configure the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_standalone_manager_with_local_databases/index#[_Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a standalone {engine-name} with local databases_].

. Install the hosts in each site and add them to the cluster. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_standalone_manager_with_local_databases/#Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SM_localDB_deploy[Installing Hosts for {virt-product-fullname}] in _Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a standalone {engine-name} with local databases_.
