= Getting information about a backup

[role="_abstract"]
You can get information about a backup that you can use to start a new incremental backup.

The `list` method of the VmBackups service returns the following information about a backup:

    * the id of each disk that was backed up
    * the ids of the start and end checkpoints of the backup
    * the id of the disk image of the backup, for each disk included in the backup
    * the status of the backup
    * the date the backup was created

When the value of <status> is `ready`, the response includes <to_checkpoint_id> which should be used as the <from_checkpoint_id> in the next incremental backup and you can start downloading the disks to back up the virtual machine storage.

.Procedure

* To get information about a backup with id 456 of a virtual machine with id 123, send a request like this:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
GET /ovirt-engine/api/vms/456/backups/123
----
+
The response includes the backup with id 456, with <from_checkpoint_id> 999 and <to_checkpoint_id> 666. The disks included in the backup are referenced in the <link> element.
