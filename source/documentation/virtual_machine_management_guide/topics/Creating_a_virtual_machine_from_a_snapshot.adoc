==== Creating a Virtual Machine from a Snapshot

You can use a snapshot to create another virtual machine.

*Creating a Virtual Machine from a Snapshot*

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines] and select a virtual machine.
. Click the virtual machine's name to go to the details view.
. Click the *Snapshots* tab to list the available snapshots.
. Select a snapshot in the list displayed and click *Clone*.
. Enter the *Name* of the virtual machine.
. Click btn:[OK].


After a short time, the cloned virtual machine appears in the *Virtual Machines* tab in the navigation pane with a status of `Image Locked`. The virtual machine remains in this state until {virt-product-fullname} completes the creation of the virtual machine. A virtual machine with a preallocated 20 GB hard drive takes about fifteen minutes to create. Sparsely-allocated virtual disks take less time to create than do preallocated virtual disks.

When the virtual machine is ready to use, its status changes from `Image Locked` to `Down` in menu:Compute[Virtual Machines].
