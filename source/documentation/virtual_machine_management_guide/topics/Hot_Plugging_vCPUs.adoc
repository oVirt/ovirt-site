=== Hot Plugging vCPUs

You can hot plug vCPUs. Hot plugging means enabling or disabling devices while a virtual machine is running.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Hot unplugging a vCPU is only supported if the vCPU was previously hot plugged. A virtual machine's vCPUs cannot be hot unplugged to less vCPUs than it was originally created with.
====
The following prerequisites apply:


* The virtual machine's *Operating System* must be explicitly set in the *New Virtual Machine* or *Edit Virtual Machine* window.

* The virtual machine's operating system must support CPU hot plug. See the table below for support details.

* Windows virtual machines must have the guest agents installed. See xref:Installing_the_Guest_Agents_and_Drivers_on_Windows[].

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines] and select a running virtual machine.
. Click btn:[Edit].
