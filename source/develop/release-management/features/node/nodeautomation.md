## Detailed Description

A framework is beeing developed which allows to run arbitary tests on an up-and-running oVirt Node. A main focus was to make the framework and handling host agnostic (so running in a VM as well as on real hardware without any modifications).

## Benefit to oVirt

Detecting regressions early and offering a more stable oVirt Node image.
