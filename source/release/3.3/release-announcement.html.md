# OVirt 3.3 release announcement

## What is oVirt

oVirt is a KVM management application for datacenter management. It is the leading open source alternative to VMware vSphere. You can use oVirt to manage hundreds of KVM hypervisor nodes, running thousands of VMs.

oVirt provides a very sophisticated management application for systems administrators, while also providing a simpler self-service user console which exposes basic functiopnality related to creating and managing virtual machine instances. The management interface gives you a central location to manage all of your storage, network and compute resources, and to handle authentication and authorization for users of your virtualized infrastructure.

oVirt provides all of the features you expect from a datacenter management application, including:

*   Live migration of VMs
*   Live storage migration
*   Templates and snapshots of running VMs
*   Make your VMs highly available
*   A small footprint hypervisor operating system ready to deploy
*   RESTful APIs to allow easy automation of VM lifecycle
*   Integration of remote desktop access to VM instances
*   Support for iSCSI, FCoE, NFS, and Gluster for shared storage

oVirt builds on KVM, the only hypervizor technology integrated into the heart of the Linux kernel. Add more stuff about how great KVM and qemu are.

## What's hot in 3.3

Summarise all of the Gluster integration work we've done since 3.1

### Extensibility and automation

Provide a summary of the types of things that administrators can do to automate, script, and extend in oVirt to give them total control over their virtualization management engine
