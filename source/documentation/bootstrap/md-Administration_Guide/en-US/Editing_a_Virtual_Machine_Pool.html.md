# Editing a Virtual Machine Pool

After a virtual machine pool has been created, its properties can be edited. The properties available when editing a virtual machine pool are identical to those available when creating a new virtual machine pool except that the **Number of VMs** property is replaced by **Increase number of VMs in pool by**.

**Note:** When editing a virtual machine pool, the changes introduced affect only new virtual machines. Virtual machines that existed already at the time of the introduced changes remain unaffected.
