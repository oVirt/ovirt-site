## Benefit to oVirt

The advantage of this implementation is that it's lightweight and scalable.

## Detailed Description

Currently we use a single process ('Remote File Handler') for each io request to remote storage (NFS). We want to replace the use of 'remote File Handler' with ioprocess. ioprocess is a C implementation providing a single process that can serve multiple io requests.

### VDSM

The change is planned to occur in two phases.

Phase 1: A single ioprocess will replace the existing process pool and storage side will be exposed to the same interface and configuration, only underlying implementation will change.

Phase 2 (future work): A single ioprocess will serve a single storage domain (TBD). out of process interface to storage will change and expose the actual ioprocess and its new file handling functions implementation.
