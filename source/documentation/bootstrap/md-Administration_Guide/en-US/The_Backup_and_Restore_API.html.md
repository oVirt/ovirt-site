# The Backup and Restore API

The backup and restore API is a collection of functions that allows you to perform full or file-level backup and restoration of virtual machines. The API combines several components of Red Hat Virtualization, such as live snapshots and the REST API, to create and work with temporary volumes that can be attached to a virtual machine containing backup software provided by an independent software provider.

For supported third-party backup vendors, consult the Red Hat Virtualization Ecosystem at [Red Hat Marketplace](http://marketplace.redhat.com/rhev/products).

**Note:** For information on how to work with the REST API, see [The Backup and Restore API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/single/rest-api-guide/#chap-The_Backup_and_Restore_API) in the *REST API Guide*.
