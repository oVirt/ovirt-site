# oVirt Test Day 3.1

## Objective

The purpose of test days initiative is to accomplish the following goals:

*   Get multiple engineers and stakeholders to have hands-on opportunity to learn more about Ovirt functionality and features.
*   Improve the quality of oVirt, towards its second release (aka '3.1')
*   While learning about the project, the stakeholders can come with their own test cases, in different categories:
    -   General/Project installation
    -   Storage
    -   Networking
    -   APIs, SDK, CLI
    -   Spice
    -   User Interface
    -   Tools

## Participants

Test Days are open to anyone. If you have your own setup we will provide all the software packages and the required information. Please refer - What to do as a participant - in the section below, if you're willing to participate please add yourself to the below table:

## Test Dates

The overall test dates are spread across multiple duration which are driven by the beta releases from the engineering. The following are the list of test days scheduled -

*   JAN 18th, 2012 - First Release (3.0)
*   Jun 14th, 2012 - Second Release (3.1)

## Execution Plan and Guidelines

The following is the list of categories which we would like to focus on. However the scope is not limited and they are guidelines only. Feel free to extend it to the limitations of the software.

### General

You need at least two physical servers to install and configure a basic yet complete oVirt environment with shared storage to exercise the following:

### Network

*   Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*   Advanced configurations:

![](Vlan bonding.jpg "fig:Vlan bonding.jpg") make sure each of the configs can:

*   survive a reboot
*   test network at both host and VM level
*   ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*   remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

### APIs

Beta RPMs for Fedora 17 are available from <http://www.ovirt.org/releases/beta/fedora/17/>. In order to use it create a `/etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt-engine-beta.repo` file with the following content:

    [ovirt-beta]
    name=ovirt-beta
    baseurl=http://ovirt.org/releases/beta/fedora/17
    enabled=1
    skip_if_unavailable=1
    gpgcheck=0

The run `yum install ovirt-engine`.

***Note:** Take into account that if this repository is not configured propertly you will be installing version 3.0 of the engine (it is part of Fedora 17), which is not the subject of this test day.*

In case you would like to test a product with a new test case, there is a template to be used for creating test cases. Please copy this template for the test case, and update the link in this document to point to the results table below. It is not necessary that the person who is writing the test case will also be the person executing the test case, please make sure the instructions are explicit enough that anyone who may want to participate in the test day can follow them, and execute it.

## What to do as a participant

*   If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer information detail section below
*   Update the Participants section.
*   Accomplish the goals set in objective section , run the tests, update the test matrix.
