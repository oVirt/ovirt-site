= Syntax for the engine-backup Command

The `engine-backup` command works in one of two basic modes:

[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# engine-backup --mode=backup
----

[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# engine-backup --mode=restore
----
These two modes are further extended by a set of options that allow you to specify the scope of the backup and different credentials for the engine database. Run `engine-backup --help` for a full list of options and their function.

*Basic Options*

*`--mode`*:: Specifies whether the command will perform a backup operation or a restore operation. The available options are:  `backup` (set by default), `restore`, and `verify`. You must define the `mode` option for `verify` or `restore` operations.

*`--file`*:: Specifies the path and name of a file (for example, _file_name_.backup) into which backups are saved in backup mode, and to be read as backup data in restore mode. The path is defined by default as `/var/lib/ovirt-engine-backup/`.

*`--log`*:: Specifies the path and name of a file ( for example _log_file_name_) into which logs of the backup or restore operation are written. The path is defined by default as `/var/log/ovirt-engine-backup/` .

*`--scope`*:: Specifies the scope of the backup or restore operation. There are four options: `all`, to back up or restore all databases and configuration data (set by default); `files`, to back up or restore only files on the system; `db`, to back up or restore only the {engine-name} database; and `dwhdb`, to back up or restore only the Data Warehouse database.
+
The `--scope` option can be specified multiple times in the same `engine-backup` command.

*{engine-name} Database Options*

The following options are only available when using the `engine-backup` command in `restore` mode. The option syntax below applies to restoring the {engine-name} database. The same options exist for restoring the Data Warehouse database. See `engine-backup --help` for the Data Warehouse option syntax.

*`--provision-db`*:: Creates a PostgreSQL database for the {engine-name} database backup to be restored to. This is a required option when restoring a backup on a remote host or fresh installation that does not have a PostgreSQL database already configured. When this option is used in restore mode, the `--restore-permissions` option is added by default.

*`--provision-all-databases`*:: Creates databases for all data dumps included in the archive. When enabled, this is the default.
//This means, that the minimum for restoring on a new system, if the backed up system used only defaults, is: engine-backup --mode=restore --file=FILE

*`--change-db-credentials`*:: Allows you to specify alternate credentials for restoring the {engine-name} database using credentials other than those stored in the backup itself. See `engine-backup --help` for the additional parameters required by this option.

*`--restore-permissions` or `--no-restore-permissions`*:: Restores (or does not restore) the permissions of database users. One of these options is required when restoring a backup. When the `--provision-*` option is used in restore mode, `--restore-permissions` is applied by default.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a backup contains grants for extra database users, restoring the backup with the `--restore-permissions` and `--provision-db` (or `--provision-dwh-db`) options will create the extra users with random passwords. You must change these passwords manually if the extra users require access to the restored system. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2686731[How to grant access to an extra database user after restoring Red Hat Virtualization from a backup].
