## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL


## RELEASE CANDIDATE

In order to install this Release Candidate you will need to enable pre-release repository.




In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41-pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41-pre.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).



### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade-guide/upgrade-guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

### Enhancements

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1490810](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1490810) <b>print task list to log in TooManyTasks issue</b><br>Feature: To make the troubleshooting easier, emit in the logs a dump of pending tasks when the Vdsm Executor queue is full.<br><br>Reason: Vdsm performs periodic monitoring and periodic maintenance task using one async executor, based on a thread pool. If operations becomes too slow or blocks, the internal queue becomes full and the periodic operations are no longer performed. The "TooManyTasks" exception can be seen in the logs. In those circumstances, to make it easier understand what Vdsm was attempting, Vdsm dumps the content of the executor queue in the logs.<br><br>Result: new warning added in the logs. The warning is throttled, meaning that it is emitted the first time it happens, and at most once every ten seconds.

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1471658](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1471658) <b>[HC] Hosted engine deployment should enable gfapi access for cluster</b><br>Feature: Enabling gfapi during HE installation<br><br>Reason: For the HC deployment, we want the gfapi access to be enabled for the "Default" cluster during HE deployment. <br><br>Result: You could use additional config file with:<br><br>OVEHOSTED_ENGINE/enableLibgfapi=bool:True<br><br>to enable libgfapi during HE setup
