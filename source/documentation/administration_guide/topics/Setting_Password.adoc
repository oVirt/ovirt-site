==== Setting a User Password

You can create a password. You must set a value for `--password-valid-to`, otherwise the password expiry time defaults to the current time. The date format is `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssX`. In this example, `-0800` stands for GMT minus 8 hours. For more options, run `ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool user password-reset --help`.

By default, the password policy for user accounts on the internal domain has the following restrictions:

* A minimum of 6 characters.

* Three previous passwords used cannot be set again during the password change.

For more information on the password policy and other default settings, run `ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool settings show`.
