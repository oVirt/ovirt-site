## Testing

The whole [Test Case](http://www.ovirt.org/Category:TestCase) collection must work on Fedora 21.

## Contingency Plan

The feature is self contained: if support for Fedora 21 won't be ready for 3.6.0 we won't deliver Fedora 21 RPMs.

      Support for running oVirt on Fedora 21 (or similar) has been added providing custom packaging of JBoss Application Server 7.
