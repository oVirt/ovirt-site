# Community guidelines

We want to keep the oVirt Community a great place to participate, but we need your help to keep it that way. While we have specific guidelines for various tools, in general, you should:

*   Be nice
*   Keep it clean
*   Keep it legal
*   Stay on topic

## Specific guidelines

*   [Mailing list guidelines](#Mailing_list_guidelines)
*   [IRC guidelines](#IRC_guidelines)
*   [Wiki contribution guidelines](#Wiki_contribution_guidelines)
*   [Bug reporting guidelines](#Bug_reporting_guidelines)

## Guideline Violations - 3 Strikes Method

The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we do need a fair way to deal with people who are making our community an unpleasant place.

*   First occurrence: Public reminder that the behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.
*   Second occurrence: Private message warning the user that any additional violations will result in removal from the community.
*   Third occurrence: Depending on the violation, may include account deletion or banning.

**Notes:**

*   Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. This is necessary to keep the community free of spam.
*   Violations are forgiven after extended periods of good behavior.
*   Minor formatting / style infractions will be dealt with through education, not the 3 strikes process.
*   Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive or illegal nature will be addressed immediately and are not subject to 3 strikes.
*   Contact [Dave neary](User:DNeary) to report abuse or appeal violations (mistakes happen & will be corrected).
