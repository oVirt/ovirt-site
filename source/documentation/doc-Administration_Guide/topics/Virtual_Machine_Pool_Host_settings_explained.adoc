==== Virtual Machine Pool Host Settings Explained

The following table details the options available on the *Host* tab of the *New Pool* and *Edit Pool* windows.

.Virtual Machine Pool: Host Settings
[options="header"]
|===
|Field Name |Sub-element |Description
|*Start Running On* | a|Defines the preferred host on which the virtual machine is to run. Select either:

* *Any Host in Cluster* - The virtual machine can start and run on any available host in the cluster.

* *Specific Host(s)* - The virtual machine will start running on a particular host in the cluster. However, the {engine-name} or an administrator can migrate the virtual machine to a different host in the cluster depending on the migration and high-availability settings of the virtual machine. Select the specific host or group of hosts from the list of available hosts.

|*CPU options*
|*Pass-Through Host CPU*
|When selected, allows virtual machines to use the host's CPU flags.
When selected, *Migration Options* is set to *Allow manual migration only*.

|
|*Migrate only to hosts with the same TSC frequency*
|When selected, this virtual machine can only be migrated to a host with the same TSC frequency. This option is only valid for High Performance virtual machines.

|*Migration Options* |*Migration mode* a|Defines options to run and migrate the virtual machine. If the options here are not used, the virtual machine will run or migrate according to its cluster's policy.

* *Allow manual and automatic migration* - The virtual machine can be automatically migrated from one host to another in accordance with the status of the environment, or manually by an administrator.

* *Allow manual migration only* - The virtual machine can only be migrated from one host to another manually by an administrator.

* *Do not allow migration* - The virtual machine cannot be migrated, either automatically or manually.

| |*Migration policy* a|Defines the migration convergence policy. If the check box is left unselected, the host determines the policy.

* *Cluster default (Minimal downtime)* - Overrides in `vdsm.conf` are still applied. The guest agent hook mechanism is disabled.

* *Minimal downtime* - Allows the virtual machine to migrate in typical situations. Virtual machines should not experience any significant downtime. The migration will be aborted if virtual machine migration does not converge after a long time (dependent on QEMU iterations, with a maximum of 500 milliseconds). The guest agent hook mechanism is enabled.

* *Post-copy migration* - When used, post-copy migration pauses the migrating virtual machine vCPUs on the source host, transfers only a minimum of memory pages, activates the virtual machine vCPUs on the destination host, and transfers the remaining memory pages while the virtual machine is running on the destination.
+
The post-copy policy first tries pre-copy to verify whether convergence can occur. The migration switches to post-copy if the virtual machine migration does not converge after a long time.
+
This significantly reduces the downtime of the migrated virtual machine, and also guarantees that the migration finishes regardless of how rapidly the memory pages of the source virtual machine change. It is optimal for migrating virtual machines in heavy continuous use, which would not be possible to migrate with standard pre-copy migration.
+
The disadvantage of this policy is that in the post-copy phase, the virtual machine may slow down significantly as the missing parts of memory are transferred between the hosts.
+
[WARNING]
====
If the network connection breaks prior to the completion of the post-copy process, the {engine-name} pauses and then kills the running virtual machine. Do not use post-copy migration if the virtual machine availability is critical or if the migration network is unstable.
====

* *Suspend workload if needed* - Allows the virtual machine to migrate in most situations, including when the virtual machine is running a heavy workload. Because of this, virtual machines may experience a more significant downtime than with some other settings. The migration may still be aborted for extreme workloads. The guest agent hook mechanism is enabled.

|
|*Enable migration encryption*
a| Allows the virtual machine to be encrypted during migration.

* *Cluster default (Don't encrypt)*
* *Encrypt*
* *Don't encrypt*
|
|*Configure NUMA* |*NUMA Node Count* |The number of virtual NUMA nodes available in a host that can be assigned to the virtual machine.
| |*NUMA Pinning* |Opens the *NUMA Topology* window. This window shows the host's total CPUs, memory, and NUMA nodes, and the virtual machine's virtual NUMA nodes. You can manually pin virtual NUMA nodes to host NUMA nodes by clicking and dragging each vNUMA from the box on the right to a NUMA node on the left.

You can also set *Tune Mode* for memory allocation:

*Strict* - Memory allocation will fail if the memory cannot be allocated on the target node.

*Preferred* - Memory is allocated from a single preferred node. If sufficient memory is not available, memory can be allocated from other nodes.

*Interleave* - Memory is allocated across nodes in a round-robin algorithm.

If you define NUMA pinning, *Migration Options* is set to *Allow manual migration only*.
