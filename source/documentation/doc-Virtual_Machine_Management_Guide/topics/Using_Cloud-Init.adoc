==== Using Cloud-Init to Initialize a Virtual Machine

Use Cloud-Init to automate the initial configuration of a Linux virtual machine. You can use the Cloud-Init fields to configure a virtual machine's host name, time zone, root password, authorized keys, network interfaces, and DNS service. You can also specify a custom script, a script in YAML format, to run on boot. The custom script allows for additional Cloud-Init configuration that is supported by Cloud-Init but not available in the Cloud-Init fields. For more information on custom script examples, see link:http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/examples.html[Cloud config examples].


*Using Cloud-Init to Initialize a Virtual Machine*

This procedure starts a virtual machine with a set of Cloud-Init settings. If the relevant settings are included in the template the virtual machine is based on, review the settings, make changes where appropriate, and click btn:[OK] to start the virtual machine.

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines] and select a virtual machine.
. Click the btn:[Run] drop-down button and select *Run Once*.
. Expand the *Initial Run* section and select the *Cloud-Init* check box.
. Enter a host name in the *VM Hostname* text field.
. Select the *Configure Time Zone* check box and select a time zone from the *Time Zone* drop-down menu.
. Select the *Use already configured password* check box to use the existing credentials, or clear that check box and enter a root password in the *Password* and *Verify Password* text fields to specify a new root password.
. Enter any SSH keys to be added to the authorized hosts file on the virtual machine in the *SSH Authorized Keys* text area.
. Select the *Regenerate SSH Keys* check box to regenerate SSH keys for the virtual machine.
. Enter any DNS servers in the *DNS Servers* text field.
. Enter any DNS search domains in the *DNS Search Domains* text field.
. Select the *Network* check box and use the *+* and *-* buttons to add or remove network interfaces to or from the virtual machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must specify the correct network interface name and number (for example, `eth0`, `eno3`, `enp0s`). Otherwise, the virtual machine's interface connection will be up, but the *cloud-init* network configuration will not be defined in it. 
====

. Enter a custom script in the *Custom Script* text area. Make sure the values specified in the script are appropriate. Otherwise, the action will fail.
. Click btn:[OK].



[NOTE]
====
To check if a virtual machine has Cloud-Init installed, select a virtual machine and click the *Applications* sub-tab. Only shown if the guest agent is installed.
