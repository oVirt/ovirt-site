# Localization Mini-Howto

This is a short howto on localizing the ovirt engine user interface.
The intended primary audience for this howto is translators:

1. Create an account on [Zanata](https://zanata.phx.ovirt.org/)
2. Login on [Zanata](https://zanata.phx.ovirt.org/)
3. Request to join your language group, this usually takes a few hours or up to a day
4. See the list of languages being translated within Zanata [oVirt project](https://zanata.phx.ovirt.org/explore?dswid=9352)
5. If the language you want to translate is not yet included in the project please ask for it to be added sending an email to devel@ovirt.org
6. As soon as you joined your language-group and oVirt has that language added, you can start translating on the Zanata web interface for [oVirt project](https://zanata.phx.ovirt.org/explore?dswid=9352).
