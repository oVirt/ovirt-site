Installing a Windows virtual machine involves the following key steps: 

. Create a blank virtual machine on which to install an operating system.
. Add a virtual disk for storage.
. Add a network interface to connect the virtual machine to the network.
. Attach the Windows guest tools CD to the virtual machine so that VirtIO-optimized device drivers can be installed during the operating system installation.
. Install a Windows operating system on the virtual machine. See your operating system's documentation for instructions.
. During the installation, install guest agents and drivers for additional virtual machine functionality.


When all of these steps are complete, the new virtual machine is functional and ready to perform tasks.
