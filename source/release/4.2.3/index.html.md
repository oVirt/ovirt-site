# oVirt 4.2.3 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.3 Second Release Candidate as of April 18, 2018.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4,
CentOS Linux 7.4 (or similar).


To find out how to interact with oVirt developers and users and ask questions,
visit our [community page]"(/community/).
All issues or bugs should be reported via
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).
The oVirt Project makes no guarantees as to its suitability or usefulness.
This pre-release should not to be used in production, and it is not feature
complete.


For a general overview of oVirt, read the [Quick Start Guide](/documentation/quickstart/quickstart-guide/)
and visit the [About oVirt](/documentation/introduction/about-ovirt/) page.

For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.3, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL


## RELEASE CANDIDATE

In order to install this Release Candidate you will need to enable pre-release repository.




In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42-pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42-pre.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).



### No Fedora support

Regretfully, Fedora is not supported anymore, and RPMs for it are not provided.
These are still built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
At this point, we only try to fix problems specific to Fedora if they affect
developers. For some of the work to be done to restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade-guide/upgrade-guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## What's New in 4.2.3?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1550135](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1550135) <b>Failed logging attempts are not audited / logged</b><br>Failed login attempts will have a audit log event associated with it showing the details of the error and the user name who failed to login.
 - [BZ 1540955](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1540955) <b>The Affinity Positive/Negative Value is not updated in the UI window</b><br>The host to VM affinity can now be explicitly disabled, as described in Bug 1493149.<br><br>This change adds 4 new columns to the affinity group table in the UI:<br>- 'vm polarity' - Shows if the VM affinity is positive, negative or disabled<br>- 'vm enforcing' - Shows if the VM affinity is enforcing or not<br>- 'host polarity' - Shows if the VM to host affinity is positive, negative or disabled<br>- 'host enforcing' - Shows if the VM to host affinity is enforcing or not
 - [BZ 1518541](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1518541) <b>[RFE] Monitor capacity of vdo-enabled brick devices and gluster volumes</b><br>Feature: Added monitoring of thin storage devices (thin provisioned, compressed or deduplicated)<br><br>Reason: With thin devices number of available 'free bytes' on storage domain may not be relevant. Storage domain may report that you have a lot of space, while actually you are quite limited. Because of that we need to monitor actually available space and report it.<br><br>Result: Now we report guaranteed free space (meaning, that you will be able to write at least as much data and may be more) for gluster bricks, bluster volumes and for gluster based storage domains.
 - [BZ 1555268](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1555268) <b>[RFE] Kernel address space layout randomization [KASLR] suppor</b><br>
 - [BZ 1554111](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1554111) <b>[RFE] - Report MTU on iface</b><br>Please extend the LLDP note in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2-beta/html-single/administration_guide/#Editing_host_network_interfaces<br>to refer to the new bit of data. It is recommended to check that the MTU of the logical network is less or equal to that supported by peer switches.
 - [BZ 1566366](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1566366) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.4] [RFE] [RHV] Add support to query illegal images in unlock_entity.sh</b><br>
 - [BZ 1540973](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1540973) <b>hosts rule in affinity group is always enabled in rest response API (even if disabled in UI )</b><br>Feature: <br>The host to VM affinity can now be explicitly disabled. Previously it was always enabled, but it had no effect if no hosts were assigned to the affinity group.<br><br>Reason: <br>Having the affinity always enabled could be confusing when using the REST API.
 - [BZ 1565099](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1565099) <b>Bump required Ansible version to 2.5</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Ansible 2.5 is now required for engine and all Ansible roles distributed with oVirt engine<br><br>Reason: <br><br>Result:

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1551350](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1551350) <b>[RFE] Add support for querying information from QEMU Guest Agent</b><br>It is now possible to obtain infomation like hostname, OS info, time zone and active users on VMs where ovirt-guest-agent is not installed and only QEMU Guest Agent is present.
 - [BZ 1518541](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1518541) <b>[RFE] Monitor capacity of vdo-enabled brick devices and gluster volumes</b><br>Feature: Added monitoring of thin storage devices (thin provisioned, compressed or deduplicated)<br><br>Reason: With thin devices number of available 'free bytes' on storage domain may not be relevant. Storage domain may report that you have a lot of space, while actually you are quite limited. Because of that we need to monitor actually available space and report it.<br><br>Result: Now we report guaranteed free space (meaning, that you will be able to write at least as much data and may be more) for gluster bricks, bluster volumes and for gluster based storage domains.
 - [BZ 1334982](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1334982) <b>[RFE] Gracefully shutdown Virtual Machines on Host reboot/shutdown.</b><br>Previously, in cases of emergency,  users were required to shut down the hosts to preserve the data center. This caused running virtual machines to be killed by the systemd process without performing a graceful shutdown. As a result, the virtual machine's state became undefined which led to problematic scenarios for virtual machines running databases such as Oracle and SAP.<br>In this release, virtual machines can be gracefully shut down by delaying the systemd process. Only after the virtual machines are shut down, does the systemd process take control and continue the shut down. The VDSM is only shut down after the virtual machines have been gracefully shut down, after passing information to the Manager and waiting 5 seconds for the Manager to acknowledge the virtual machines have been shut down.
 - [BZ 1447300](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1447300) <b>enable libguestfs tools on ppc64le</b><br>Sparsify and sysprep can now be run on POWER hosts.
 - [BZ 1550106](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1550106) <b>[RFE] IOProcess thread of storage domain should be correlated to the domain id/name</b><br>Feature: <br>Log IOProcessClient's name<br><br>Reason: <br>Before this patch, IOProcessesClient name used a counter (e.g. "ioprocess-0") and it was impossible to correlate ioprocess to the storage domain.<br><br>Result:<br>This patch changes the client name in IOProcessClient to one of the following (as described in the patch):<br>- "Global"<br>- "domain-uuid"<br>- "/[GlusterSD/]server:_path"

#### oVirt Engine Metrics

 - [BZ 1563681](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1563681) <b>Add OpenShift 3.9 ansible inventory file and copy in to metrics store machine</b><br>Feature: <br>To make OpenShift installation easier, we generate the inventory files and vars.yml file and copy them to the metrics store machine.<br> <br>Reason: <br>To make OpenShift installation easier<br><br>Result: <br>The user does not need to handle the inventory and vars.yml file and can use them when running the OpenShift ansible playbooks.
 - [BZ 1560240](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1560240) <b>OpenShift Logging should use the partition supplied by the user for elasticsearch persistent storage</b><br>In this release, it is possible to configure a persistent storage partition other than the default partition (/var) for Elasticsearch, by setting a parameter in the OpenShift Ansible inventory files.

#### cockpit-ovirt

 - [BZ 1547464](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1547464) <b>[RFE]Tick mark on one check box  in brick configuration should check mark  all the bricks under that device.</b><br>
