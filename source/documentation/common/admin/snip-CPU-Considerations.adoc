*CPU Considerations*

* *For non-CPU-intensive workloads*, you can run virtual machines with a total number of processor cores greater than the number of cores in the host (the number of processor cores for a single virtual machine must not exceed the number of cores in the host). The following benefits can be achieved:

** You can run a greater number of virtual machines, which reduces hardware requirements.
** You can configure virtual machines with CPU topologies that are otherwise not possible, such as when the number of virtual cores is between the number of host cores and the number of host threads.

* *For best performance, and especially for CPU-intensive workloads*, you should use the same topology in the virtual machine as in the host, so the host and the virtual machine expect the same cache usage. When the host has hyperthreading enabled, QEMU treats the host's hyperthreads as cores, so the virtual machine is not aware that it is running on a single core with multiple threads. This behavior might impact the performance of a virtual machine, because a virtual core that actually corresponds to a hyperthread in the host core might share a single cache with another hyperthread in the same host core, while the virtual machine treats it as a separate core.
