# Localization Mini-Howto

This is a short howto on localizing the ovirt engine user interface.
The intended primary audience for this howto is translators:

1. Present yourself on `users@ovirt.org` mailing list and ask for an account on [Zanata](https://zanata.ovirt.org/)
2. Login on [Zanata](https://zanata.ovirt.org/)
3. Request to join your language group, this usually takes a few hours or up to a day
4. See the list of languages being translated within Zanata [oVirt project](https://zanata.ovirt.org/explore)
5. If the language you want to translate is not yet included in the project please ask for it to be added sending an email to `devel@ovirt.org`
6. As soon as you joined your language-group and oVirt has that language added, you can start translating on the Zanata web interface for [oVirt project](https://zanata.ovirt.org/).
7. Check known localization [bugzilla issues](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=classification%3Aovirt%20cf_ovirt_team%3Ai18n)
   and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Aovirt+label%3Ai18n)
