= Setting Up and Configuring SR-IOV

This topic summarizes the steps for setting up and configuring SR-IOV, with links out to topics that cover each step in detail.

== Prerequisites

Set up your hardware in accordance with the link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}html/hardware_considerations_for_implementing_sr-iov/index[Hardware Considerations for Implementing SR-IOV]

== Set Up and Configure SR-IOV

To set up and configure SR-IOV, complete the following tasks.

. link:{URL_virt_product_docs}installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_cockpit_web_interface/
. link:{URL_virt_product_docs}administration_guide/#Editing_VFs_on_NIC[Editing the virtual function configuration on a NIC].

. link:{URL_virt_product_docs}administration_guide/#Enabling_Passthrough_on_a_vNIC_Profile[Enabling passthrough on a vNIC Profile].

. link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}html/virtual_machine_management_guide/sect-migrating_virtual_machines_between_hosts#Configuring_virtual_vachines_with_SR-IOV-Enabled_vNICs[Configuring Virtual Machines with SR-IOV-Enabled vNICs to Reduce Network Outage during Migration].

.Notes

- The number of the 'passthrough' vNICs depends on the number of available virtual functions (VFs) on the host. For example, to run a virtual machine (VM) with three SR-IOV cards (vNICs), the host must have three or more VFs enabled.
- Hotplug and unplug are supported.
- Live migration is supported.
- To migrate a VM, the destination host must also have enough available VFs to receive the VM. During the migration, the VM releases a number of VFs on the source host and occupies the same number of VFs on the destination host.
- On the host, you will see a device, link, or ifcae like any other interface. That device disappears when it is attached to a VM, and reappears when it is released.
- Avoid attaching a host device directly to a VM for SR-IOV feature.
- To use a VF as a trunk port with several VLANs and configure the VLANs within the Guest, please see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3951231[Cannot configure VLAN on SR-IOV VF interfaces inside the Virtual Machine].


Here is an example of what the libvirt XML for the interface would look like:
[source, xml]
  ----
  <interface type='hostdev'>
     <mac address='00:1a:yy:xx:vv:xx'/>
     <driver name='vfio'/>
     <source>
       <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x05' slot='0x10' function='0x0'/>
     </source>
     <alias name='ua-18400536-5688-4477-8471-be720e9efc68'/>
     <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x08' function='0x0'/>
   </interface>
   ----



.Troubleshooting

The following example shows you how to get diagnostic information about the VFs attached to an interface.

....
# ip -s link show dev enp5s0f0
