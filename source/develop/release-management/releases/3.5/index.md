The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of its sixth formal release, oVirt 3.5.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an excellent KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [oVirt 3.4 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.4/), [oVirt 3.3 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.3/), [oVirt 3.2 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.2/) and [oVirt 3.1 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.1/). For a general overview of oVirt, read [the oVirt 3.0 feature guide](/develop/release-management/releases/3.0/feature-guide/) and the [about oVirt](/community/about.html) page.

# oVirt 3.5 Release Notes

## Live Merge

If an image has one or more snapshots, oVirt 3.5's merge command will combine the data of one volume into another. [Live merges](/develop/release-management/features/storage/live-merge/) can be performed with data is pulled from one snapshot into another snapshot. The engine can merge multiple disks at the same time and each merge can independently fail or succeed in each operation.

**Note:** This is currently a restricted use case. You must be running a Fedora 20 host that has been updated from the virt-preview yum repository. See [this page](/develop/release-management/features/storage/live-merge/#important:-special-environment-setup) for more details.

## Import Storage Domain

This latest release expands oVirt's feature of [importing ISOs and exporting storage domains](/develop/release-management/features/storage/importstoragedomain/) to expand support for importing an existing data storage domain. Based on information stored in the storage domain, oVirt can revive entities such as disks, virtual machines, and templates in the setup of any data center to which the storage domain is attached.

## Advanced Foreman Integration

oVirt 3.5 adds the capability to provision and add hypervisors to oVirt from bare metal. Foreman is a complete lifecycle management tool for physical and virtual servers. Through deep integration with configuration management, DHCP, DNS, TFTP, and PXE-based unattended installations, Foreman manages every stage of the lifecycle of your physical or virtual servers. Integrating [Foreman with oVirt](/develop/release-management/features/foreman/advancedforemanintegration/) helps add hypervisor hosts managed by Foreman to the oVirt engine.

## Enhanced Authentication, Authorization and Accounting Support

A new architecture has been built for oVirt 3.5's [authentication, authorization and accounting](/develop/release-management/features/infra/aaa/) (AAA) system. The enhancements will provide a clear separation of authentication from authorization and provide a developer API to develop custom extensions for authentication and authorization.

## New PatternFly Interface

oVirt 3.5 will have a new look and feel, using PatternFly, the open interface project. The [new look and feel](/develop/release-management/features/ux/newlookandfeelpatternflyphase1/) aims to maintain the colors and spirit associated with oVirt, while updating it with a new, modern, sleek, and minimal look. The minimal design allows complex screens to look cleaner and airier, and lets the user focus on the data and the tasks by removing all extraneous visual elements.

## Advanced Scheduling with Optaplanner

The [Optaplanner](/develop/release-management/features/sla/optaplanner/) is a new service that takes a snapshot of a cluster (a list of hosts and VMs) and computes an optimized VM-to-Host assignment solution. Optimization will is done on per Cluster basis. The administrator can use this information as a hint to tweak the cluster to better utilize resources.

## Other Enhancements

### Infra

*   JSON remote procedure call over stomp was added to the communication layer between the engine and VDSM. This new protocol is designed to be simple, require less parsing than the currently implemented XML remote procedure calls, and introduces asynchronous communication.

### Networking

*   [Unified Persistence](/develop/release-management/features/network/networkreloaded/#unified-persistence) is a way for oVirt-defined network configurations in hosts to be set in a format that is distribution agnostic and that closely matches the oVirt network setup API.
*   A [Neutron Virtual Appliance](/develop/release-management/features/cloud/neutronvirtualappliance/) will be available from the oVirt Image Repository (glance.ovirt.org). For 3.5, the appliance is based on OpenStack IceHouse, listed as ""Neutron Appliance (CentOS X.X) - IceHouse-YYYY.X-XX" on the provided images list.

### Integration

*   It is now possible to setup the engine and [WebSocket-Proxy](/develop/release-management/features/integration/websocketproxy-on-a-separate-host/), [DWH](/develop/release-management/features/engine/separate-dwh-host/), [Reports](/develop/release-management/features/engine/separate-reports-host/) on separate hosts.
*   [Hosted Engine](/develop/release-management/features/storage/read-only-disk/) has now added support for [iSCSI storage](/develop/release-management/features/engine/self-hosted-engine-iscsi-support/), VLAN-tagged network interfaces, bonded network interfaces, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (or similar).
*   [oVirt Windows Guest Tools](/develop/release-management/features/engine/windows-guest-tools/) for oVirt 3.5 are now available as a release candidate.

## Install / Upgrade from Previous Versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

oVirt 3.5 is now available for use. In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`     # yum localinstall `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm)

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you should have the ovirt-release34 package already installed on your system. You can then install ovirt-release35.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

If you are upgrading from oVirt < 3.4.1, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.4.1 or later. Please see [oVirt 3.4.1 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.4.1/) for upgrade instructions.

Once ovirt-release35 package is installed, you will have the ovirt-3.5-stable repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.

If you're using pre-release repo you'll need to re-enable pre release repository:

      [ovirt-3.5-pre]
      name=Latest oVirt 3.5 Pre Release
`#baseurl=`[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5-pre/rpm/fc$releasever/`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5-pre/rpm/fc$releasever/)
`mirrorlist=`[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/mirrorlist-ovirt-3.5-pre-fc$releasever`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/mirrorlist-ovirt-3.5-pre-fc$releasever)
      enabled=1
      skip_if_unavailable=1
      gpgcheck=1
`gpgkey=`[`file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-ovirt-3.5`](file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-ovirt-3.5)

and to run:

          # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
          # engine-setup

## oVirt Live

An oVirt Live ISO is available:

[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5/iso/ovirt-live-el6-3.5.0.iso`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5/iso/ovirt-live-el6-3.5.0.iso)

## oVirt Node

An oVirt Node build will be also available soon in:

[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5/iso`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5/iso)

Pre-release version is still available here:

[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5-pre/iso/ovirt-node-iso-3.5.0.ovirt35.20140630.el6.iso`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5-pre/iso/ovirt-node-iso-3.5.0.ovirt35.20140630.el6.iso)

*   To circumvent some SELinux issues, please append enforcing=0 to the kernel commandline when booting the ISO.
*   The ISO is missing the plugin for Hosted Engine, but we hope to deliver an iso that includes this plugin shortly.

## <span class="mw-customtoggle-0" style="font-size:small; display:inline-block; float:right;"><span class="mw-customtoggletext">[Click to Show/Hide]</span></span>Known Issues

<div  id="mw-customcollapsible-0" class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
*   If you are using a Fedora 19 host, you have to download libvirt >= 1.0.2-1, which is now a hard requirement (pkg will be provided from ovirt repo, but if it not there, you can update from a Fedora 20 repo: : yum update --releasever=20 libvirt\\\* ).
*   If you cannot refresh an ISO file list after adding a host, see for a workaround.
*   Upgrading from 3.5 alpha can fail due to the structure of a table being different in 3.5 alpha to that in 3.5 beta1 and later .
*   Users that use DWH and Reports from 3.5 first beta will need to run # yum distro-sync "ovirt-engine-dwh\*" "ovirt-engine-reports\*" due to bad rpm release number for DWH and reports packages.
*   Live Merge: Limit merge operations based on hosts' capabilities
*   engine-cleanup could refuse to remove the engine due to a bad handling of not definitive version numbers. For a quick and dirty workaround, simply set RPM_VERSION = '3.5.0_master' in /usr/share/ovirt-engine/setup/ovirt_engine_setup/config.py just for the cleanup. See
*   For proper network configuration, NetworkManager and firewalld have to be turned off
*   If you're updating vdsm package you'll need to remove vdsm-api before updating in order to avoid conflicts with vdsm-jsonrpc
*   When upgrading cluster / data center version from 3.x to 3.5 the default disk profile is not added and needs to be added manually for all storage domains in the data center ( )
*   Foreman integration on CentOS is supported only on CentOS 6.6 due to java package issues
