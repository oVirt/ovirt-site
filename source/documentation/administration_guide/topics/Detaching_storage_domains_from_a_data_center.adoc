==== Detaching a Storage Domain from a Data Center

Detaching a storage domain from a data center stops the data center from associating with that storage domain. The storage domain is not removed from the {virt-product-fullname} environment; it can be attached to another data center.

Data, such as virtual machines and templates, remains attached to the storage domain.

[NOTE]
====
The master storage, if it is the last available storage domain, cannot be removed.
