# oVirt 4.2.0 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.0
Release as of December 19, 2017.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4,
CentOS Linux 7.4 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

## What's New in 4.2.0?

- The [Administration Portal](/blog/2017/09/introducing-ovirt-4.2.0/) has been redesigned using [Patternfly](http://www.patternfly.org). The new user interface is more intuitive and user-friendly, and features improved performance.

- A new **VM Portal** for non-admin users. Built with performance and ease of use in mind, the new VM portal delivers a more streamlined experience.

- A [High Performance VM type](/blog/2017/10/introducing-high-performance-vms/) has been added to the existing "Server" and "Desktop" types. The new type enables administrators to easily optimize a VM for high performance workloads.

- The **oVirt Metrics Store** is a real-time monitoring solution providing complete infrastructure visibility, for data-based decision making and faster issue resolution.

- oVirt now supports VM connectivity via **software defined networks** - implemented by **Open Virtual Network (OVN)**. OVN is automatically deployed to hypervisors, and made available for VM connectivity. Networks can be defined in the UI, over REST, or within the ManageIQ [Gaprindashvili](http://manageiq.org/blog/2017/12/Announcing-Gaprindashvili-RC/) release (now in RC).

- Support for [Nvidia vGPU](http://www.nvidia.com/object/grid-technology.html), a technology that enables users to shard a GRID-capable physical GPU into several smaller instances, for GPU-accelerated workloads.

- The [ovirt-ansible-roles](/blog/2017/07/ovirt-ansible-roles-an-introduction/) package helps users with [common administration tasks](/blog/2017/08/ovirt-ansible-roles-how-to-use/). All roles can be executed from the command line using Ansible, and some are executed directly from oVirt engine.

- oVirt will now use [PostgresSQL 9.5](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/release-9-5.html) as its database, for improved performance.

- Support for [LLDP](/blog/2017/11/webadmin-lldp/), enabling oVirt hosts to gather information from their networking interfaces, for improved network configuration. The information can be displayed both in the UI and via an API.

- **Snapshots** can be uploaded and downloaded via the REST API (and the SDKs).

- A new **self-hosted engine wizard UI**. Among other improvements it now enables users to review and edit their inputs before beginning the deployment process.

- **Hosted Engine Ansible-based deployment** (in Beta),using “ovirt-hosted-engine-setup  --ansible”, is a new method to deploy a hosted engine. It reduces deployment issues, and will enable users to benefit from future features such as single storage for the hosted engine and other VMs, live storage migration, and improved hosted engine VM editing capabilities. We expect it to become the default provisioning flow for Hosted Engine and would be glad to get feedback on its functionality!

- The **ipa-client package** is now installed on hosts and included in the oVirt Node. This identity management feature provides users with a seamless experience while moving between [Cockpit](http://cockpit-project.org/) and other products.

- **Virt-v2v** now supports Debian/Ubuntu based VMs, in addition to EL and Windows-based VMs.

- Restored support for **Gluster ISO domains**.

- Improved **Affinity Label management tools** were incorporated into the cluster, host, and VM’s edit dialogs.

- oVirt now features **Gluster 3.12.**

- oVirt's hyperconverged solution now enables a single **replica Gluster deployment.**

- Improved **self-hosted-engine iSCSI deployment**.

- A new **driver for Win10**, for seamless remote access to VMs, and improved performance.

- Administrators can now use the Administration Portal to **remove a LUN** from the storage domain.

- Instead of polling libvirt every 2 seconds to get the used disk for each thin disk, VDSM now uses **events**, for a noticeable increase in efficiency on a host with tens or hundreds of VMs.

- In addition, oVirt 4.2.0 features **host scalability** improvements, for high density setups.

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.0, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup

### No Fedora support

Regretfully, Fedora is not supported anymore, and RPMs for it are not provided.
These are still built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
At this point, we only try to fix problems specific to Fedora if they affect
developers. For some of the work to be done to restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.


### Release Note

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1438822](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1438822) <b>The discard_enable flag should not be used anymore in oVirt 4.2</b><br>With this update, support for configuring "Discard After Delete" per host has been dropped. This also drops the value "discard_enable" from the VDSM configuration file. The "Discard After Delete" feature now needs to be configured per block storage domain. For more information see - http://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/storage/discard-after-delete/

#### oVirt Web UI

 - [BZ 1507406](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1507406) <b>Rebase ovirt-web-ui to 1.3.z</b><br>With this update, the Virtual Machine Portal has been updated to version 1.3.1 and adds the following functionality:<br>- Use of "AlwaysFilterResultsForWebUi" engine configuration parameter<br>- BnB (Brand new Branding) - aligned with ovirt-engine<br>- Smartcard Enabled option<br>- SSH public key<br>- Guest Operating System names as labels<br>- i18n improvements, first translations<br>- multiple fixes and minor UI enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1490784](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1490784) <b>blacklist RHEL <6.9 from machine types pseries-rhel7.4.0+</b><br>With this update, Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions less than version 6.9 are not supported in clusters using the machine type pseries-rhel7.4.0 or newer (4.1+). It is now blacklisted and cannot be started due to there being no CPU architecture available. A new definition of guest operating system for Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 6.9 and greater has been added and should be used for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 guests in Red Hat Virtualization 4.1 and greater clusters. Also note that the cluster compatibility version 4.2 requires the pseries-rhel7.5.0 machine type, which is introduced by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 hosts. Until they are available you need to keep using the 4.1 cluster compatibility level.
 - [BZ 1425935](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1425935) <b>[RFE] Add SSO client command line registration tool</b><br>This update includes the new ovirt-register-sso-client-tool command-line tool to register SSO clients.<br><br>When running the tool, the user is prompted to enter the client ID, callback prefix, and the certificate location. A new entry is created in the sso_clients table if one does not exist, or the existing one with the same client ID is updated. The client_secret which is written to a temporary file should be noted and used by the client. <br><br>The client secret in the sso_clients table is encrypted and is for SSO internal use only.
 - [BZ 1463083](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1463083) <b>RESTAPI - Attaching a storage domain to 4.0 DC fails due to discard after delete is now True by default but not supported</b><br>Previously, when adding a new data storage domain without stating the values of Discard After Delete (DAD) and storage format, their default values were previously calculated according to the data center version of the host that added the storage domain. Discard After Delete was set to true for a data center greater than or equal to Red Hat Virtualization 4.1, otherwise it was set to false. The storage format was set V4 for the a data center greater than or equal to Red Hat Virtualization 4.1, otherwise it was set to V3. This was a bad heuristic since the data center of the host that added the domain is a random data center and it is not necessarily the data center that the domain will be later attached to. Now, the logic has been changed so that the default storage format for new data domains will be the latest format, currently it is V4. For non-data domains, nothing has changed V1 was and will remain the default value. The default value of Discard After Delete will be calculated according to the storage format and is set to true for storage formats greater than or equal to V4, otherwise it is set to false.
 - [BZ 1420310](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1420310) <b>User actions should succeed regardless of 'filter' parameter</b><br>With this update, an issue with the the way that the API supports the 'filter' parameter to indicate if results should be filtered according to the permissions of the user has been corrected. Previously, due to the way this was implemented, non-admin users needed to set this parameter for almost all operations, as the default value was 'false'. Now, to simplify the task for non-admin users, this patch changes the default value to 'true', but only for non-admin users. If the value is explicitly given in a request it will be honored.This is a backwards compatibility breaking change, as clients that used non-admin users and did *not* explicitly provide the 'filter' parameter will start to behave differently. However, this is unlikely, as calls from non-admin users without the 'filter=true' are almost useless. For those unlikely cases where this may be a problem, the patch also introduces a new 'ENGINE_API_FILTER_BY_DEFAULT' configuration parameter:<br>    <br>  #<br>  # This flags indicates if 'filtering' should be enabled by default for<br>  # users that aren't administrators.<br>  #<br>  ENGINE_API_FILTER_BY_DEFAULT="true"<br>    <br>If it is necessary to revert to the behavior of previous versions of the engine, it can be achieved by changing this parameter in a configuration file inside the '/etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d' directory. For<br>example:<br>    <br>  # echo 'ENGINE_API_FILTER_BY_DEFAULT="false"' > \<br>  /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/99-filter-by-default.conf<br>    <br>  # systemctl restart ovirt-engine

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1490041](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1490041) <b>[RFE] Provide IdM client software in RHVH</b><br>ipa-client package is now installed on hosts and is included in oVirt Node / RHV-H<br>This allows to integrate cockpit certificate signing and SSO with Red Hat IdM and adding the host to IdM realm.

#### OTOPI

 - [BZ 1411100](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1411100) <b>[RFE] Change timestamp format to include timezone for logs</b><br>From now on, all timestamp records for otopi-based tools logs (including engine-setup, host-deploy, and hosted-engine --deploy) will contain a time zone to ease correlation between logs on the Manager and hosts. They will also now include the fraction of a second. Previously they contained a timestamp without a time zone and fraction of a second, for example:<br><br>2017-04-03 09:56:58 DEBUG otopi.context context.dumpEnvironment:760 ENVIRONMENT DUMP - BEGIN<br><br>From now on there will always be a comma and fraction of a second after the seconds part, and a timezone identifier at the end of the timestamp part, for example:<br><br>2017-04-05 10:41:08,500+0300 DEBUG otopi.context context.dumpEnvironment:760 ENVIRONMENT DUMP - BEGIN
 - [BZ 1518689](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1518689) <b>[RFE] otopi should log on failure list of network connections</b><br>otopi now optionally logs the list of network connections on the machine after failures. Enable this by installing the optional package otopi-debug-plugins. This can help debug failures to start network services due to "Address already in use" errors.

#### oVirt Engine SDK 4 Ruby

 - [BZ 1317450](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1317450) <b>[RFE] Have a policy for autoresume of VMs paused due to IO errors (stay paused, turn off, restart with defined time out time)</b><br>Feature: <br>Previously, if the VM has been paused due to IO Error, there was no way how to configure what should happen after the storage gets fixed. The only option was "auto resume", which resumed the VM. This feature adds two more options configurable per VM: "Kill" and "Leave Paused".<br><br>Reason: <br>There are ways how the "auto resume" together with HA VM using VM lease could lead to split brain. Other reason is that it can interfere with custom HA solutions.<br><br>Result: <br>Now the user can configure 3 resume policies for VMs:<br>- auto resume (the one which used to be the only one)<br>- leave paused<br>- kill

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1317450](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1317450) <b>[RFE] Have a policy for autoresume of VMs paused due to IO errors (stay paused, turn off, restart with defined time out time)</b><br>Feature: <br>Previously, if the VM has been paused due to IO Error, there was no way how to configure what should happen after the storage gets fixed. The only option was "auto resume", which resumed the VM. This feature adds two more options configurable per VM: "Kill" and "Leave Paused".<br><br>Reason: <br>There are ways how the "auto resume" together with HA VM using VM lease could lead to split brain. Other reason is that it can interfere with custom HA solutions.<br><br>Result: <br>Now the user can configure 3 resume policies for VMs:<br>- auto resume (the one which used to be the only one)<br>- leave paused<br>- kill
 - [BZ 1181665](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1181665) <b>[RFE][scale] Use events and not polling to detect disk usage [using the improvement from platform bug 1181659]</b><br>Feature: <br>Vdsm can make use of the event added in libvirt 3.2.0 to learn about the allocation of block chunked drives and improve the efficiency of the thin provisioning implementation.<br><br>Reason: <br>To implement the thin provisioning of block chunked drives, Vdsm needs to periodically monitor the allocation of the backing volumes. This could be done either polling libvirt or registering events. The second option is available since libvirt 3.2.0 and it is way more efficient than the first.<br><br><br>Result: <br>When using events, Vdsm consumes much less system resources.
 - [BZ 1376843](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1376843) <b>[RFE] Implement a keep-alive with reconnect if needed logic for the python jsonrpc client</b><br>jsonrpc python client is now able to reconnect in case jsonrpc server has restarted.
 - [BZ 1205739](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1205739) <b>[RFE][DR] - Allow recovering an imported domain without an UP DC</b><br>Cause: <br>Can not attach storage domain with "dirty" SP_UUID.<br>This process fails since the host is not yet connected<br>to a storage pool and therefore there is no host id which we can use to take a lock on the storage domain.<br><br>Consequence: <br>When attempting to attach an imported storage domain to a Data Center. <br><br>Fix: <br>Enable the possibility to force detach a storage domain<br>even if the host is not yet connected to the storage pool.<br><br>Result:<br>Enable the option for force detach a storage<br>domain and clean its SP_UUID before we will want to connect it to the storage pool.
 - [BZ 1391859](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1391859) <b>[RFE] When creating thick allocated disks on file-based storage, use '-o preallocation=falloc' instead of 'dd' with zeros.</b><br>New feature greatly reduces the time required to create thick allocated disks on file-based storage.
 - [BZ 1228543](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1228543) <b>[RFE] hot-unplug memory</b><br>Previously, it was only possible to add memory to a running virtual machine (VM). To remove memory, the VM had to be shut down.<br>In this release, it is now possible to hot unplug memory from a running VM, provided that certain requirements are met and limitations are considered.
 - [BZ 1168327](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1168327) <b>Live Merge: optimize internal volume size</b><br>After live merge, the base volume is reduced to its optimal size.
 - [BZ 1430799](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1430799) <b>Create script to restore original network configuration of removed vdsm host</b><br>Feature:<br>Provide tools for simple removal of networks configured by oVirt on a host.<br><br>Reason: <br>One could add a host into Engine and one minute later decide to remove it. But the host would have ovirtmgmt bridge and various VDSM network hacks which are not clear how to remove.<br><br>Result:<br>vdsm-tool now provides commands for VDSM network cleanup, particularly `vdsm-tool clear-nets` and `vdsm-tool dummybr-remove`. One could remove networks configured by VDSM following the steps below. Note that vdsm service is not required to be running:<br><br>1. To prevent loss of connectivity it might be needed to exclude default route network from cleanup. Look for a network providing default route (ovirtmgmt by default):<br># vdsm-tool list-nets<br>...<br>ovirtmgmt (default route)<br>...<br><br>2. Remove all networks configured by VDSM except for the default network.<br># vdsm-tool clear-nets --exclude-net ovirtmgmt<br><br>3. Remove libvirt dummy bridge ;vdsmdummy;<br># vdsm-tool dummybr-remove<br><br>4. Host should be clean, you can remove vdsm now.
 - [BZ 1367806](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1367806) <b>[RFE] - Add "blkdiscard" as a new method to zero volumes</b><br>A new VDSM parameter enables a host to remove a disk/snapshot on block storage, where "Wipe After Delete" is enabled, in much less time than the "dd" command, especially if the storage supports "Write same."
 - [BZ 1335642](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1335642) <b>[RFE] Users should be able to seal VMs from RHEV-M</b><br>The feature is documented here: http://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/virt-sysprep/

#### oVirt Cockpit Plugin

 - [BZ 1493851](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1493851) <b>[RFE] Suggest to give a hint when HE with one host don't permit to put itself into local maintenance.</b><br>Feature: The Hosted Engine management page in cockpit-ovirt now presents a warning message if only one host is available in the hosted engine cluster, preventing it from being moved to local maintenance. <br><br>Reason: Hosted Engine does not allow moving the last (or only) host running hosted engine to local maintenance, only global.<br><br>Result: cockpit-ovirt now reflects the options supported by hosted engine.

#### imgbased

 - [BZ 1503148](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1503148) <b>[RFE] translate between basic ntp configurations and chrony configurations</b><br>
 - [BZ 1420068](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1420068) <b>[RFE] RHV-H should meet NIST 800-53 partitioning requirements by default</b><br>In this release, Red Hat Virtualization Host supports NIST SP 800-53 partitioning requirements to improve the security. Environments upgrading to Red Hat Virtualization 4.2 will also be configured to match NIST SP 800-53 partitioning requirements.

#### oVirt Engine SDK 4 Python

Instead it can be saved and reused and expired only in case of error.<br><br>Result: Monitoring loop execution time decreased significantly
 - [BZ 1149579](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1149579) <b>[RFE][hosted-engine-setup] [iSCSI support] allow selecting more than one iSCSI target</b><br>You can connect to more than one iSCSI target if you connect all the portals of an iSCSI portal group to enable multipathing before running the self-hosted engine deployment script. To be as backwards-compatible as possible and to avoid requiring changes in the deployment script, it saves the multiple IP and port values as a string composed of multiple comma-separated values with the same key used by the previous version. It assumes that the login is the same for all the portals.
 - [BZ 1457471](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1457471) <b>Flood of getHardwareInfo (every 2 seconds or so) by ovirt-ha-agent</b><br>ovirt-ha-agent was renewing its json rpc connection to vdsm on each message using getHardwareInfo to verify it.<br>Now that the json rpc client internally supports a reconnect mechanism, there is not need to always create a fresh connection on ovirt-ha-agent side.
 - [BZ 1417708](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1417708) <b>ovirt-ha-agent should reuse json-rpc connections</b><br>Feature: <br>In the past ovirt-ha-agent was opening a new connection each time it had to communicate with vdsm while now, for performance reasons, it can try to reuse an open connection if still valid.<br><br>Reason: <br>Performance reasons.<br><br>Result:<br>ovirt-ha-agent reuses an open json-rpc connection if available

 - [BZ 1149579](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1149579) <b>[RFE][hosted-engine-setup] [iSCSI support] allow selecting more than one iSCSI target</b><br>You can connect to more than one iSCSI target if you connect all the portals of an iSCSI portal group to enable multipathing before running the self-hosted engine deployment script. To be as backwards-compatible as possible and to avoid requiring changes in the deployment script, it saves the multiple IP and port values as a string composed of multiple comma-separated values with the same key used by the previous version. It assumes that the login is the same for all the portals.
 - [BZ 1461251](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1461251) <b>[bug] hosted-engine yum repo required, but rpm-based install optional</b><br>Feature: <br>Provide path to Appliance OVF<br><br>Reason: <br>This feature is supported according to RedHat customer portal, but dropped in the past for some reason<br><br>Result: <br>User can provide path to appliance OVA instead of installing appliance RPM
 - [BZ 1429537](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1429537) <b>[RFE] Rebase on gluster-3.12</b><br>Self-hosted engines now require GlusterFS 3.10 instead of 3.8.

#### oVirt Log Collector

 - [BZ 1490447](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1490447) <b>[RFE] option to collect logs from one host per cluster</b><br>Feature: <br>Introduce hypervisor-per-cluster option, to collect data from a single hypervisor per cluster. If the SPM found in the cluster, collect data from it.<br><br>Reason: <br>Simplifies collecting data.<br><br>Result: <br>Data is collected from a single host per cluster.

 - [BZ 1020790](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1020790) <b>[RFE] - add options to rhevm-log-collector to limit size of collected logs</b><br>The ovirt-log-collector can now limit the maximum size of logs collected in order to capture relevant logs only. The size of the logs may be extremely large in environments with large numbers of hosts or a large number of exceptions, so ovirt-log-collector can now arbitrarily limit the size of logs collected, defaulting to the last day only.
 - [BZ 1404509](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1404509) <b>[RFE] Log collector should collect time diff for all hosts</b><br>When collecting SOS reports from hosts, chrony and systemd SOS plugins can now collect information about time synchronization. In addition, a new --time-only option has been added to ovirt-log-collector, allowing information about time differences to be gathered from the hosts without gathering full SOS reports, saving a considerable amount of time for the operation.
 - [BZ 1023455](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1023455) <b>[CodeChange][RFE] log-collector should use the same code used by the engine for parsing configuration</b><br>

#### oVirt Provider OVN

 - [BZ 1505398](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1505398) <b>OVS 2.6 obscures OVS 2.7 due to misuse of the epoch</b><br>This ensures that openvswitch version 1:2.6.1 (version: 2.6.1 epoch:1) is not consumed when the provider is installed. Ovs package 1:2.6.1 is a beta package which should not be used (but has accidentally been in the repos). <br><br>When ovs is not installed, the result will be that the correct version (if available) will be installed. <br><br>If 1:2.6.1 is already installed, the install operation will fail with the message: "... conflicts with openvswitch = 1:2.6.1 ...". <br>Manual action will be needed to replace the package. The user will have to manually change the openvswitch packages to the latest available.<br>The improper package version can be replaced by downloading and replacing the openvswitch packages with a specific version of openvswitch:<br><br>- download each of the openvswitch packages:<br>    - provider: openvswitch, openvswitch-ovn-common, openvswitch-ovn-central, python-openvswitch<br>    - driver: openvswitch, openvswitch-ovn-common, openvswitch-ovn-host, python-openvswitch<br>  yumdownloader <package>-<version><br>  for example: yumdownloader openvswitch-2.7.2<br><br>- install the new version using the downloaded rpm files<br>  yum downgrade <package><br>  for example:<br>  yum downgrade openvswitch-2.7.2-10.git20170914.el7fdp.x86_64.rpm

### Rebase: Enhancementss Only

#### oVirt Release Package

 - [BZ 1429541](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1429541) <b>Rebase on Gluster 3.12</b><br>oVirt release now enables CentOS Storage SIG Gluster 3.10 repository. See Gluster 3.10 release notes for more information  at https://gluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-notes/3.10.0/

### Deprecated Functionality

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1456558](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1456558) <b>iptables support deprecation</b><br>With this update, iptables has been deprecated in favor of firewalld. In Red Hat Virtualization 4.2 it is still possible to use iptables but iptables will not be supported in future releases.
 - [BZ 1443989](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1443989) <b>[RFE] Deprecate and remove spice-html5 support</b><br>The spice-html5 has been removed.
 - [BZ 1473182](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1473182) <b>Drop ovirt-engine-setup-plugin-dockerc</b><br>With this update, the ovirt-engine-setup-plugin-dockerc package has been dropped. The ovirt-engine-setup-plugin-dockerc package was previously deprecated in version 4.1.5.

#### oVirt Host Deploy

 - [BZ 1426580](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1426580) <b>Remove qemu-kvm-tools installation</b><br>With this update, the Host Deploy is no longer installing qemu-kvm-tools on deployed hosts.

### Known Issue

#### imgbased

 - [BZ 1454536](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1454536) <b>HostedEngine setup fails if RHV-H timezone < UTC set during installation</b><br>Currently, the Red Hat Virtualization Host generates VDSM certificates at the time of the first boot. This means that if the system clock was not set correctly at install time then chrony or ntpd may resynchronize the clock after the VDSM certificate was generated, leading to a certificate that is not valid yet if the appropriate timezone is behind UTC. A workaround for this is to set the system clock appropriately at install time. Now, imgbased-configure-vdsm starts after chronyd or ntpd and waits two seconds for the clock to synchronize, but this is not a guarantee.
