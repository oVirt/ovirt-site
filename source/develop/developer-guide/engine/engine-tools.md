### Tools TODO

1.  Standardize the usage of all tools and make them consistent
2.  Create common infrastructure both for Java programs and for the wrapping scripts e.g. functions to fulfill classpath dependencies, etc.
3.  Use comon paths for all
4.  Use a single logger library (apache-commons-logging)
