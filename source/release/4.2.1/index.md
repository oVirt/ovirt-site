# oVirt 4.2.1 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.1
release as of February 12, 2018.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4,
CentOS Linux 7.4 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.1, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### No Fedora support

Regretfully, Fedora is not supported anymore, and RPMs for it are not provided.
These are still built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
At this point, we only try to fix problems specific to Fedora if they affect
developers. For some of the work to be done to restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## What's New in 4.2.1?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1515635](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1515635) <b>[RFE] Drop uuid_generate_v1() internal implementation and use the implementation from standard PostgreSQL uuid-ossp extension</b><br>We have added a requirement for uuid-ossp PostgreSQL extension to be present in engine database. For databases managed by engine-setup this is performed automatically, but non-managed databases (usually remote databases) this needs to be done manually by administrators.<br><br>Here are required additional steps:<br><br>New installation:<br>  1. Requirement to install rh-postgresql95-postgresql-contrib package<br>     on remote database host<br>  2. Once database is created administrators need to add uuid-ossp extension<br>     to it using: <br>       su - postgres -c "scl enable rh-postgresql95 \-- psql -d engine"<br>       postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";<br><br>Upgrade:<br>  1. Requirement to install rh-postgresql95-postgresql-contrib package<br>     on remote database host<br>  2. Once database is upgraded to 9.5 administrators need to remove our custom implementation and add uuid-ossp extension<br>     to it using: <br>       su - postgres -c "scl enable rh-postgresql95 \-- psql -d engine"<br>       postgres=# DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS uuid_generate_v1();<br>       postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";<br><br>In both above example "engine" specified using "-d" option is the name of engine database

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine Metrics

 - [BZ 1523068](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1523068) <b>[RFE] Add fluentd file output plugin support for quick and easy debugging</b><br>Feature:<br>Add fluentd file output plugin support for quick and easy debugging <br><br>Reason: <br>Sometimes we want to debug the metrics without setting a remote metrics store.<br><br>Result: <br>Added a "file" output plugin support to the ovirt-engine-metrics setup.<br>Metrics will be sent to a local file.

#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1425032](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1425032) <b>[RFE] Include katello agent in RHV-H NG</b><br>Feature: Katello Agent is now installed on RHV hosts during deployment and is included in RHV-H image<br><br>Reason: to better integrate with Satellite. Katello Agent provides the list of the installed rpms.<br><br>Result: katello-agent is installed and working on RHV / RHV-H Hosts

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1353713](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1353713) <b>[RFE] - Hosted Engine: iSCSI Setup Should use different User/Password For Discovery and Portal</b><br>hosted-engine-setup was assuming that the user set the same CHAP username and password for iSCSI discovery and iSCSI login.<br>Let the user pass different username and password couples for iSCSI discover and iSCSI login at setup time.

#### OTOPI

 - [BZ 1396925](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1396925) <b>[RFE] restructure answer-file behavior</b><br>otopi can now optionally write its own answer files, which are simpler to understand, compared to tool-specific files written by existing tools that use otopi. Also functionality is different, imitating more closely the behavior without an answer file and answers provided interactively.

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1510578](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1510578) <b>[RFE][hc][dalton] - Set up cgroup for gluster processes in HC mode from the engine</b><br>Feature: Restrict the CPU resources consumed by gluster processes <br><br>Reason: When running in hyperconverged mode, gluster processes should co-exist with virt processes and not consume all available resources<br><br>Result: Hyperconverged mode works as expected
 - [BZ 1511823](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1511823) <b>[RFE] Automatically synchronize networks of cluster with default network provider</b><br>Feature:<br>Add a new boolean property to external network providers is added.<br>If true, the networks of this provider are automatically and cyclically synchronized to oVirt in the background. This means that all new networks of this provider are imported, and all discarded networks are removed from all clusters that have this external provider as the default provider.<br><br>The automatically initiated import triggers the following steps:<br><br> - The networks of the external provider will be imported to every data center in the data centers of the clusters that have that external provider as the default provider.<br><br> - A vNIC profile will be created for each involved data center and network.<br><br> - The networks will be assigned to each cluster that has that external provider as the default provider.<br><br>All users are allowed to use the new vNIC Profile.<br><br>Reason:<br> - Support the user to use only external networks for VMs, which are still available<br>   on the external provider.<br> - Make new networks of the external network provider available more comfortable.<br><br>Result:<br>After the user has enabled the new boolean property, e.g. during creating the external provider, the networks of the external provider are available to be used for VMs without manually importing them.
 - [BZ 1530730](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1530730) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.1] [RFE] Allow uploading ISO images to data domains and using them in VMs</b><br>It is now possible to upload an ISO file to a data domain and attach it to a VM as a CDROM device.<br>In order to do so the user has to upload an ISO file via the UI (which will recognize the ISO by it's header and will upload it as ISO) or via the APIs in which case the request should define the disk container "content_type" property as "iso" before the upload.<br>Once the ISO exists on an active storage domain in the data center it will be possible to attach it to a VM as a CDROM device either through the "Edit VM" dialog or through the APIs (see example in comment #27
 - [BZ 1330217](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1330217) <b>[RFE] Enable configuring IPv6 in VM cloud-init</b><br>Cloud-Init supports IPv6 properties for initializing a virtual machine's network interfaces.
 - [BZ 1517832](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1517832) <b>[RFE] make VM names in host details clickable</b><br>Feature: Clicking on the VM name in the VM detail view of the hosts, will take you directly to the VM detail view. This allows you to see more details of that VM and make changes easier.<br><br>Reason: Navigating between hosts and their associated VMs was difficult. This change allows the user to quickly switch selected entities.<br><br>Result: The names of the VMs in the VM grid of the host detail view now contains a link to the VM detail view.
 - [BZ 1049604](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1049604) <b>[RFE] Allow uploading a pre-existing VM image (OVA) into the environment</b><br>Feature: <br>Enable uploading an OVA into an oVirt data center.<br><br>Reason: <br>Simplify the process of importing a virtual machine that was created out of the data center.<br><br>Result: <br>It is now possible to import an OVA that is accessible to at least of the hosts in the data center into a virtual machine in oVirt.
 - [BZ 1528960](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1528960) <b>Add ability to change maximum timeout for Ansible process executed from engine to finish</b><br>The default timeout for Ansible process executed from engine has been enlarged to 30 minutes, because especially upgrading hosts can take significant amount of time. If Ansible process doesn't finish until this timeout, engine will kill the Ansible process and fail the action.<br><br>If even default 30 minutes timeout is not enough, administrators can further enlarge it by creating a new configuration file in /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d (for example 99-ansible-playbook-timeout.conf) with following content:<br><br>  ANSIBLE_PLAYBOOK_EXEC_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=NNN<br><br>where NNN is number minutes which engine should wait for Ansible process to finish.

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1334982](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1334982) <b>[RFE] Gracefully shutdown Virtual Machines on Host reboot/shutdown.</b><br>Previously, in cases of emergency,  users were required to shut down the hosts to preserve the data center. This caused running virtual machines to be killed by the systemd process without performing a graceful shutdown. As a result, the virtual machine's state became undefined which led to problematic scenarios for virtual machines running databases such as Oracle and SAP.<br>In this release, virtual machines can be gracefully shut down by delaying the systemd process. Only after the virtual machines are shut down, does the systemd process take control and continue the shut down. The VDSM is only shut down after the virtual machines have been gracefully shut down, after passing information to the Manager and waiting 5 seconds for the Manager to acknowledge the virtual machines have been shut down.
 - [BZ 1530730](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1530730) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.1] [RFE] Allow uploading ISO images to data domains and using them in VMs</b><br>It is now possible to upload an ISO file to a data domain and attach it to a VM as a CDROM device.<br>In order to do so the user has to upload an ISO file via the UI (which will recognize the ISO by it's header and will upload it as ISO) or via the APIs in which case the request should define the disk container "content_type" property as "iso" before the upload.<br>Once the ISO exists on an active storage domain in the data center it will be possible to attach it to a VM as a CDROM device either through the "Edit VM" dialog or through the APIs (see example in comment #27
 - [BZ 1429536](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1429536) <b>[RFE] Rebase on gluster-3.12</b><br>Feature: oVirt to use the latest released version of glusterfs - 3.12<br><br>Reason: GlusterFS 3.12 has many fixes and enhancements that improve experience for oVirt users
 - [BZ 1511234](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1511234) <b>[RFE] Hook for booting from Passthrough Devices</b><br>New vdsm hook boot_hostdev has been added. It allows Virtual Machines to boot from passed through host devices such as NIC VFs, PCI-E SAS/RAID Cards, SCSI devices etc. without requiring a normal bootable disk from RHV SD/Direct LUN

#### oVirt Engine SDK 4 Python

 - [BZ 1049604](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1049604) <b>[RFE] Allow uploading a pre-existing VM image (OVA) into the environment</b><br>Feature: <br>Enable uploading an OVA into an oVirt data center.<br><br>Reason: <br>Simplify the process of importing a virtual machine that was created out of the data center.<br><br>Result: <br>It is now possible to import an OVA that is accessible to at least of the hosts in the data center into a virtual machine in oVirt.

### Known Issue

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1523614](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1523614) <b>Copy image to a block storage destination does not work after disk extension in a snapshot in DC pre-4.0</b><br>Cause: <br>qemu-img convert with compat=0.10 and a backing file writes <br>the space after the backing file as zeroes which may cause the output disk be larger than the LV created for it<br><br>Consequence: <br>Moving a disk that has snapshot created prior to its extension will fail in storage domains with a version older than V4 (i.e., domains in DC 4.0 or older)<br><br>Fix: <br>The move operation of a disk with snapshots created prior to its extension will be blocked with an error message stating the deletion of the disk's snapshot is required before attempting to move it, instead of attempting to execute the copying and waiting for it to fail.<br><br>Result:

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1543988](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1543988) <b>hosted-engine --get-shared-config rewrites all the hosted-engine configuration files loosing spm id</b><br>Cause: <br>'hosted-engine --get-shared-config' and 'hosted-engine --set-shared-config' always rewrite all the HE configuration files with the copy on the shared storage.<br>/etc/ovirt-hosted-engine/hosted-engine.conf contains host_id field with the SPM ID to be used on the host while the shared copy on the shared storage that contains only host_id=1<br><br>Consequence:<br>This can cause an SPM collision in the future.<br>
<br>Workaround:<br>Manually restore host_id in /etc/ovirt-hosted-engine/hosted-engine.conf after 'hosted-engine --get-shared-config' or 'hosted-engine --set-shared-config'<br><br>
