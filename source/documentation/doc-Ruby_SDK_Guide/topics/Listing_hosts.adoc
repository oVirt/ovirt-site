:_content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="Listing_hosts"]
= Listing Hosts

This Ruby example lists the hosts.

[source, Ruby, options="nowrap"]
----
# Get the reference to the root of the services tree:
system_service = connection.system_service

# Get the reference to the service that manages the
# collection of hosts:
host_service = system_service.hosts_service

# Retrieve the list of hosts and for each one
# print its name:
host = host_service.list
host.each do |host|
  puts host.name
end
----

In an environment with only one attached host (`Atlantic`) the example outputs:
----
Atlantic
