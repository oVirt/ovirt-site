=== Ansible Roles

Multiple Ansible roles are available to help configure and manage various parts of the {virt-product-fullname} infrastructure. Ansible roles provide a method of modularizing Ansible code by breaking up large playbooks into smaller, reusable files that can be shared with other users.

The Ansible roles available for {virt-product-fullname} are categorized by the various infrustructure components.
