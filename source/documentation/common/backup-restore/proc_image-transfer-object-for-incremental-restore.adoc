= Creating an image transfer object for incremental restore

[role="_abstract"]
To enable restoring raw data backed up using the incremental backup API to a QCOW2-formatted disk, the backup application should create an `imagetransfer` object.

When the transfer format is `raw` and the underlying disk format is QCOW2, uploaded data is converted on the fly to QCOW2 format when writing to storage. Uploading data from a QCOW2 disk to a RAW disk is not supported.

Creating an image transfer object requires a request call with a body.

.Procedure

. Send a request like this:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
POST /ovirt-engine/api/imagetransfers
----

. In the request body, specify the following parameters:
+
 ** Disk ID or snapshot ID.
 ** Direction of the disk set to `upload`.
 ** Format of the disk set to `raw`.
+
For example, to transfer a backup of a disk where the ID of the disk is `123`, send the following request body:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
<image_transfer>
    <disk id="123"/>
    <direction>upload</direction>
    <format>raw</format>
</image_transfer>
----
