# oVirt Node

oVirt Node is a minimal operating system based on CentOS that is designed to provide a simple method for setting up a
physical machine to act as a hypervisor in an oVirt environment. The minimal operating system contains only the packages
required for the machine to act as a hypervisor, and features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host and
performing administrative tasks.

## Installing oVirt Node

Before you start installing oVirt Node be sure to meet requirements on your virtualization host, see
[Chapter 2.2. Host Requirements](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_cockpit_web_interface/#host-requirements) in the
[Installing oVirt as a self-hosted engine using the Cockpit web interface](https://ovirt.org/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_cockpit_web_interface/) guide.

You should also check your workstation has a supported web browser for using cockpit, see [http://cockpit-project.org/running.html](http://cockpit-project.org/running.html)
for the minimum browser requirements.

Once ready, see
[Chapter 6.1. oVirt Nodes](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_cockpit_web_interface/#Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SHE_cockpit_deploy) in the
[Installing oVirt as a self-hosted engine using the Cockpit web interface](https://ovirt.org/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_cockpit_web_interface/)
guide for installation instructions.
