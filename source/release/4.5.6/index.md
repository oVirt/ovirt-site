# oVirt 4.5.6 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.5.6 release as of February 12, 2024.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is now available on x86_64 architecture for:

* oVirt Node NG (based on CentOS Stream 8)
* oVirt Node NG (based on CentOS Stream 9)
* CentOS Stream 8
* CentOS Stream 9
* RHEL 8 and derivatives
* RHEL 9 and derivatives

page.

To learn about features introduced before 4.5.6, see the

This oVirt 4.5.6 release is meant to provide a small but crucial update due to an urgent [CVE](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4vwj-x32h-m4vj).
If you are already using oVirt master snapshot you should already have received this release content.
