# oVirt Test Day

## oVirt 3.3 test day

[oVirt 3.3 test day page](OVirt_3.3_TestDay)

## oVirt 3.2 test day

## Objective

The purpose of test days initiative is to accomplish the following goals:

*   Get multiple engineers and stakeholders to have hands-on opportunity to learn more about Ovirt functionality and features.
*   Improve the quality of oVirt, towards its first release.
*   Establish a quality baseline.
*   Introducing and validating new oVirt 3.2 features
*   While learning about the project, the stakeholders can come with their own test cases, in different categories for regression testing:
    -   installation/migration from 3.1
    -   Storage
    -   Networking
    -   interfaces
    -   Spice
    -   User Interface
    -   Tools

in addition participate in exploring [new features](OVirt_3.2_release-management#Features) .

## What to do as a participant

*   If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer information detail section below
*   Update the Participants section.
*   Accomplish the goals set in objective section , run the tests, update the test matrix.
*   Running into any issues - contact any participant in the list

## Participants

Test Days are open to anyone. If you have your own setup we will provide all the software packages and the required information. Please refer - [What to do as a participant](Testing/OvirtTestDay#What_to_do_as_a_participant) - in the section below, if you're willing to participate please add yourself to the below table:

## Test Dates

The overall test dates are spread across multiple duration which are driven by the beta releases from the engineering. The following are the list of test days scheduled -

*   JAN 18th, 2012 - First Release (3.0)
*   Jun 14th, 2012 - Second Release (3.1)
*   JAN 31th, 2013 - Third Release (3.2)

## Execution Plan and Guidelines

for **installation** check: [Ovirt_Information_Details](http://www.ovirt.org/Testing/OvirtTestDay#Ovirt_Information_Details) deployment options:

*   f18 manager (vm) + f18 hypervisors
*   f18 manager (vm) + el6 hypervisors
*   f18 manager AIO (nested virt - [http://www.ovirt.org/Vdsm_Developers#Running_Node_as_guest_-_Nested_KVM Nested_KVM](http://www.ovirt.org/Vdsm_Developers#Running_Node_as_guest_-_Nested_KVM_Nested_KVM))

The following is the list of categories which we would like to focus on. this is basically regression testing:

### General

### Network

*   Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*   Advanced configurations:

![](Vlan bonding.jpg "fig:Vlan bonding.jpg") make sure each of the configs can:

*   survive a reboot
*   test network at both host and VM level
*   ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*   remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

Bugs found:

*   Bug 906289 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Non-VM networks shown as VM networks on cluster attachment dialog
*   Bug 906291 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Non-VM networks not being detached from cluster
*   Bug 906313 - [oVirt-webadmin] [setupNetworks] "No valid Operation for <network_name> and Unassigned Logical Networks panel"
*   Bug 906383 - [vdsm] [setupNetworks] Error while attaching non-VM network to interface on Fedora 18

*   Bug 906434 - Editing vnic's type and mac are blocked when the vnic was unplugged and updated to plugged
*   Bug 906440 - Updating type of a plugged nic should be blocked on the ui side

### Tools

*   Basic operations on iso-uploader:

1.  **engine-iso-uploader list**
2.  **engine-iso-uploader upload <iso> -i <iso-domain-name> -v -f**

*   Basic operations on log-collector:

1.  **engine-log-collector list**
2.  **engine-log-collector collect**

*   Basic operation on image-uploader

**engine-image-uploader --name=<new name here> -e <domain> upload my.ovf**

#### New to v3.1:

*   port mirroring: one can setup a VM that sniffs all IP traffic between VMs on a network on a host.
*   no mac spoofing: VMs cannot emit packets with spoofed mac address (unless specifically allowed to).
*   Sync network: change network MTU (or other property) on host, verify that Engine may overwrite it with Sync network
*   Jumbo packets: see if can be configured and used by storage

#### New to v3.2:

*   Network main tab operational: you can search hosts and VM based on their network connectivity
*   Guest agent reported devices: install guest agent on a VM and see it report internal information of the vNics (internal device name, IPv4 and IPv6)
*   Network Linking: allow changing network the VM is connect to while it is running

### APIs

by default we'll be using the webadmin as our API for testing on this section we'll try to have default deployment with the different APIs

    name=ovirt-beta
    baseurl=http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/beta/rpm/Fedora/18/
    enabled=1
    skip_if_unavailable=1
    gpgcheck=0

The run `yum install ovirt-engine`.

Please refer the following documents for more information on hardware requirements, installation procedure and software download locations:

*   <http://ovirt.org/wiki/Installing_ovirt_from_rpm>
*   <http://ovirt.org/wiki/Installing_ovirt-node_from_rpm>

Please refer the following documents for Ovirt Installation guide, bits location and admin guide:

*   <http://ovirt.org/wiki/Documentation>

Please refer the following document for 'virt-to-date' tool, simple tool for setting up local yum repo with all required packages and easy deployment.

In case you would like to test a product with a new test case, there is a template to be used for creating test cases. Please copy this template for the test case, and update the link in this document to point to the results table below. It is not necessary that the person who is writing the test case will also be the person executing the test case, please make sure the instructions are explicit enough that anyone who may want to participate in the test day can follow them, and execute it.
