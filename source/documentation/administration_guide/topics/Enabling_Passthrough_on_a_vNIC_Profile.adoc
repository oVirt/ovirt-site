==== Enabling Passthrough on a vNIC Profile

include::../../common/sriov/conc-Set_Up_and_Configure_SR-IOV.adoc[]

The passthrough property of a vNIC profile enables a vNIC to be directly connected to a virtual function (VF) of an SR-IOV-enabled NIC. The vNIC will then bypass the software network virtualization and connect directly to the VF for direct device assignment.

The passthrough property cannot be enabled if the vNIC profile is already attached to a vNIC; this procedure creates a new profile to avoid this. If a vNIC profile has passthrough enabled, QoS, network filters, and port mirroring cannot be enabled on the same profile.

For more information on SR-IOV, direct device assignment, and the hardware considerations for implementing these in {virt-product-fullname}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4-beta/html/hardware_considerations_for_implementing_sr-iov/[Hardware Considerations for Implementing SR-IOV].


*Enabling Passthrough*

. Click menu:Network[Networks].
. Click the logical network's name to open the details view.
. Click the *vNIC Profiles* tab to list all vNIC profiles for that logical network.
. Click *New*.
. Enter the *Name* and *Description* of the profile.
. Select the *Passthrough* check box.
. Optionally deselect the *Migratable* check box to disable migration for vNICs using this profile. If you keep this check box selected, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}vmm-guide/Virtual_Machine_Management_Guide.html#Live_migration_prerequisites[Additional Prerequisites for Virtual Machines with SR-IOV-Enabled vNICs] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.
. If necessary, select a custom property from the custom properties list, which displays *Please select a key...* by default. Use the *+* and *-* buttons to add or remove custom properties.
. Click *OK*.


The vNIC profile is now passthrough-capable. To use this profile to directly attach a virtual machine to a NIC or PCI VF, attach the logical network to the NIC and create a new *PCI Passthrough* vNIC on the desired virtual machine that uses the passthrough vNIC profile. For more information on these procedures respectively, see xref:Editing_host_network_interfaces[], and link:{URL_virt_product_docs}vmm-guide/Virtual_Machine_Management_Guide.html#Adding_a_Network_Interface[Adding a New Network Interface] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.
