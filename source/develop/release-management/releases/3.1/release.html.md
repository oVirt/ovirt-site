# oVirt 3.1 Release

*Posted on August 8, 2012*

We are pleased to announce the version 3.1 release of oVirt!

The oVirt projectâ€™s second official release, version 3.1, ships with a set of storage, interface, and infrastructure enhancements that narrow the gaps between the open source virtualization platform and proprietary alternatives.

oVirt 3.1 adds support for capturing and cloning from live snapshots, for virtual disk and network adapter hot plugging, and for connecting externally-hosted LUNs to oVirt virtual machines. The oVirt 3.1 web administration console also includes new interfaces for managing floating virtual disks and for configuring Gluster storage volumes.

In the 3.1 release, Red Hat Directory Server and IBM Tivoli Directory Server join IPA and Active Directory as supported identity providers, which administrators may pair with initial support for user-based resource quota capabilities.

For more information on oVirt 3.1, including installation instructions, please refer to [the release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.1/).

The new release is available for [download](/get-ovirt/).

For the entire oVirt community, thanks for your participation in making this release happen. In particular, thanks to anyone who contributed to the release through testing, submitting patches, and bug reporting.
