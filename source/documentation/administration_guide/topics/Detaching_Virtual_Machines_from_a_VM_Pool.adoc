=== Detaching Virtual Machines from a Virtual Machine Pool

You can detach virtual machines from a virtual machine pool. Detaching a virtual machine removes it from the pool to become an independent virtual machine.

*Detaching Virtual Machines from a Virtual Machine Pool*

. Click menu:Compute[Pools].
. Click the pool's name. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Virtual Machines* tab to list the virtual machines in the pool.
. Ensure the virtual machine has a status of `Down`; you cannot detach a running virtual machine.
. Select one or more virtual machines and click *Detach*.
. Click btn:[OK].

[NOTE]
====
The virtual machine still exists in the environment and can be viewed and accessed from menu:Compute[Virtual Machines]. Note that the icon changes to denote that the detached virtual machine is an independent virtual machine.
