.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the host with root permissions.

.Procedure

. Open an existing `.repo` file or create a new one in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.

. Add an entry to the `.repo` file. For example, to install `sssd-ldap`, add the following entry to a new `.repo` file name `third-party.repo`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# imgbased: set-enabled
[custom-sssd-ldap]
name = Provides sssd-ldap
mirrorlist = http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=BaseOS&infra=$infra
gpgcheck = 1
enabled = 1
gpgkey = file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
includepkgs = sssd-ldap
