= Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a standalone {engine-name} with remote databases

Standalone {engine-name} installation is manual and customizable. You must install a {enterprise-linux} machine, then run the configuration script (`engine-setup`) and provide information about how you want to configure the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. Add hosts and storage after the {engine-name} is running. At least two hosts are required for virtual machine high availability.

To install the {engine-name} with a remote {engine-name} database, manually create the database on the remote machine before running `engine-setup`. To install the Data Warehouse database on a remote machine, run the Data Warehouse configuration script (`ovirt-engine-dwh-setup`) on the remote machine. This script installs the Data Warehouse service and can create the Data Warehouse database automatically.

See the link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}html-single/planning_and_prerequisites_guide/index[_Planning and Prerequisites Guide_] for information on environment options and recommended configuration.

== Installation Overview

Installing a standalone {engine-name} environment with remote databases involves the following steps:

.. xref:Installing_RHEL_for_RHVM_SM_remoteDB_deploy[Install two {enterprise-linux} machines: one for the {engine-name}, and one for the databases.] The second machine will be referred to as the remote server.

. xref:Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SM_remoteDB_deploy[Install hosts to run virtual machines on:]
.. Use either host type, or both:
* xref:Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SM_remoteDB_deploy[{hypervisor-fullname}]
* xref:Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_hosts_SM_remoteDB_deploy[{enterprise-linux}]
.. xref:Adding_standard_hosts_to_the_Manager_SM_remoteDB_deploy[Add the hosts to the {engine-name}.]

. xref:Preparing_Storage_for_RHV_SM_remoteDB_deploy[Prepare storage to use for storage domains.] You can use one of the following storage types:
* xref:Preparing_NFS_Storage_SM_remoteDB_deploy[NFS]
* xref:Preparing_iSCSI_Storage_SM_remoteDB_deploy[iSCSI]
* xref:Preparing_FCP_Storage_SM_remoteDB_deploy[Fibre Channel (FCP)]
* xref:Preparing_POSIX_Storage_SM_remoteDB_deploy[POSIX-compliant file system]
* xref:Preparing_Local_Storage_SM_remoteDB_deploy[Local storage]

. xref:Adding_Storage_Domains_to_RHV_SM_remoteDB_deploy[Add storage domains to the {engine-name}.]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keep the environment up to date. Since bug fixes for known issues are frequently released, use scheduled tasks to update the hosts and the {engine-name}.

=== Installing the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} Machine and the Remote Server

. The {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} must run on {enterprise-linux} 8. For detailed installation instructions, see link:{URL_rhel_docs_latest}html-single/performing_a_standard_rhel_installation/index[_Performing a standard {enterprise-linux-shortname} installation_].
+
This machine must meet the minimum xref:hardware-requirements_SM_remoteDB_deploy[{engine-name} hardware requirements].

. Install a second {enterprise-linux} machine to use for the databases. This machine will be referred to as the remote server.

include::../common/install/proc-Enabling_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_Repositories.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

Before configuring the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}, you must manually configure the {engine-name} database on the remote server. You can also use this procedure to manually configure the Data Warehouse database if you do not want the Data Warehouse setup script to configure it automatically.

// Adding context back after assembly
:context: install_RHVM

include::../common/install/proc-Configuring_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

Install the Data Warehouse service and database on the remote server:
