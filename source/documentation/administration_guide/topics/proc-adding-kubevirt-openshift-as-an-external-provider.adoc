= Adding KubeVirt/Openshift Virtualization as an external provider

To run virtual machines in a container on the {container-platform}, you add OpenShift as an external provider in Red Hat Virtualization.

NOTE: This capability is known as _OpenShift Virtualization_.

.Prerequisites

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/virt/install/preparing-cluster-for-virt.html[In OpenShift Container Platform, your cluster is configured for OpenShift Virtualization].

.Procedure

. In the {virt-product-shortname} Administration Portal, go to menu:Administration[Providers] and click btn:[New].

. In *Add Provider*, set *Type* to *KubeVirt/Openshift Virtualization*.

. Enter the *Provider URL* and *Token*, which are required.

. Optional: Enter values for *Advanced parameters* such as *Certificate Authority*, *Prometheus URL*, and *Prometheus Certificate Authority*.

. Click btn:[Test] to verify the connection to the new provider.

. Click btn:[OK] to finish adding this new provider.


.Verification steps

. In the {virt-product-shortname} Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Clusters].

. Click the name of new cluster you just created. This cluster name, *kubevirt* for example, is based on the name of the provider. This action opens the cluster details view.

. Click the *Hosts* tab to verify that the {container-platform} status of the worker nodes is up.
+
NOTE: Even if they are running, the status of the master nodes is down because they cannot host virtual machines.

. Use menu:Compute[Virtual Machines] to deploy a virtual machine to the new cluster.

. In the {container-platform} web console, in the *Administrator* perspective, use menu:Workloads[Virtual Machines] to view the virtual machine you deployed.
