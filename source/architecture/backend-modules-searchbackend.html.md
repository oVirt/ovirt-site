# Backend modules searchbackend

**Introduction:** searchbackend implements the search bar at the top of the GUI. You may search for entities and their relationships in a domain specific language, which is translated into an appropriate SQL query. In addition to being used to implement the search bar, the module is used to display the GUI's main tabs. The user can see the query that was ran when a tab was clicked.

For more information see [Introducing_Entity_Search](Development/Introducing_Entity_Search).
