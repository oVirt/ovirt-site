==== Importing a Virtual Machine from a Host

Import an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) file into your {virt-product-fullname} environment. You can import the file from any {hypervisor-fullname} in the data center.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, only {virt-product-fullname} and VMware OVAs can be imported. KVM and Xen are not supported.

The import process uses `virt-v2v`. Only virtual machines running operating systems compatible with `virt-v2v` can be successfully imported. For a current list of compatible operating systems, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[].
====

*Importing an OVA File*

. Copy the OVA file to a host in your cluster, in a file system location such as *var/tmp*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The location can be a local directory or a remote nfs mount, as long as it has sufficient space and is accessible to the qemu user (UID 36).
====
+
. Ensure that the OVA file has permissions allowing read/write access to the *qemu* user (UID 36) and the *kvm* group (GID 36):
