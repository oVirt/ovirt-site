==== Viewing Host Devices

You can view the host devices for each host in the *Host Devices* tab in the details view. If the host has been configured for direct device assignment, these devices can be directly attached to virtual machines for improved performance.

For more information on the hardware requirements for direct device assignment, see link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}hardware_considerations_for_implementing_sr-iov/index#[Additional Hardware Considerations for Using Device Assignment] in _Hardware Considerations for Implementing SR-IOV_.
 
For more information on configuring the host for direct device assignment, see xref:Configuring_a_Host_for_PCI_Passthrough_host_tasks[].

For more information on attaching host devices to virtual machines, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#sect-host_devices[Host Devices] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.
