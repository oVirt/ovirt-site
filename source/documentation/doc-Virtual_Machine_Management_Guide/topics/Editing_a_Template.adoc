=== Editing a Template

Once a template has been created, its properties can be edited. Because a template is a copy of a virtual machine, the options available when editing a template are identical to those in the *Edit Virtual Machine* window.


*Editing a Template*

. Click menu:Compute[Templates] and select a template.
. Click btn:[Edit].
. Change the necessary properties. Click *Show Advanced Options* and edit the template's settings as required. The settings that appear in the *Edit Template* window are identical to those in the *Edit Virtual Machine* window, but with the relevant fields only. See xref:sect-Explanation_of_Settings_in_the_New_Virtual_Machine_and_Edit_Virtual_Machine_Windows[] for details.
. Click btn:[OK].
