# Feature Development Process

## Development Process

The Design part of a feature is just as critical as writing the code. Good design dictates understanding user's requirements and translating it to solid architecture, taking into account ease of use, feature completeness, integration with other features, scalability, security and of course, maintainability.

As we always practice in oVirt, feature design is an open and transparent process, with the wish and expectation that the design will be peer reviewed by community members - developers and users alike.

### Feature design Review Process Goals

The feature review process goals are:

1.  Ensure the feature meets the user's requirements.
2.  Propose technical design improvements to the feature.
3.  Follow the values of openness, transparency, community.
4.  Ensure the feature meets the user's requirements.
5.  Ensure feature is well integrated into the overall project goals and functionality.
6.  Provide a basis for documenting the feature in the project documentation.
7.  Allow Quality Engineering to understand how the feature works and prepare a test plan accordingly.

The oVirt project uses GitHub in order to review feature designs that will eventually be posted to the oVirt website.

### Basic Principles to submit a feature page

-  Copy the feature template ([feature page template](feature-template.html.md))
-  Edit relevant fields
-  Fill relevant content
-  Send for review as a PR (Pull Request)

#### Review Process

1.  Feature pages are sent as PRs for review
2.  A peer thoughtfully reviews the design
3.  Feedback gratefully received
4.  All discussions on the feature are done via the PR and/or the mailing lists (users and devel)
5.  Consensus formed, ACK or NAK agreed - PR merged if ACK'ed.

##### who's my reviewer?

If you don't know who is should review your feature page you can ping the devel mailing list with the link to pull request.
