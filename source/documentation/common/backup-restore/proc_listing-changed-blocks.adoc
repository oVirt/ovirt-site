= Listing changed blocks

[role="_abstract"]
The backup application gets a list of changed blocks, specifically, a map of zeros and data ranges in storage, from the ovirt-imageio API for every image transfer. If a change list is not available, the backup application gets an error. See the link:http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-imageio/images.html[ovirt-imageio Images API]

////
* What is the ovirt-imageio API?

* Why is a separate API necessary?
////

You can include the query option `dirty=y` to return only ranges modified since a backup checkpoint id
Send a request specifying desired options to list the desired information.

_Dirty_ refers to a range of data that has been modified since a backup checkpoint id, referred to as a ticket-uuid in the imageio API.

The response body should include a list of JSON objects with these keys:

[horizontal]
data:: `true` for allocated ranges, `false` for zero or unallocated ranges
start:: offset of range in bytes
length:: number of bytes

.Prerequisites

* Knowledge of the ovirt-imageio Image API.

.Procedure

* To list data and zero ranges, send a request like this:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
GET /images/__ticket-uuid__/map
----
+
The response body should appear similar to this:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
[
    {"data": true, "start": 0, "length": 1048576},
    {"data": false, "start": 1048576, "length": 8192},
    {"data": true, "start": 1056768, "length": 1048576},
]
