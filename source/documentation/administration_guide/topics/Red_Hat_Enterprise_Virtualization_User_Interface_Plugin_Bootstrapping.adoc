==== {virt-product-fullname} User Interface Plug-in Bootstrapping

A typical plug-in bootstrap sequence consists of following steps:


*Plug-in Bootstrap Sequence*

. Obtain pluginApi instance for the given plug-in
. Obtain runtime plug-in configuration object (optional)
. Register relevant event handler functions
. Notify UI plug-in infrastructure to proceed with plug-in initialization


The following code snippet illustrates the above mentioned steps in practice:
	
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----

// Access plug-in API using 'parent' due to this code being evaluated within the context of an iframe element.
// As 'parent.pluginApi' is subject to Same-Origin Policy, this will only work when WebAdmin HTML page and plug-in
// host page are served from same origin. WebAdmin HTML page and plug-in host page will always be on same origin
// when using UI plug-in infrastructure support to serve plug-in resource files.
var api = parent.pluginApi('MyPlugin');

// Runtime configuration object associated with the plug-in (or an empty object).
var config = api.configObject();

// Register event handler function(s) for later invocation by UI plug-in infrastructure.
api.register({
	    // UiInit event handler function.
		UiInit: function() {
				// Handle UiInit event.
					window.alert('Favorite music band is ' + config.band);
					    }
});

// Notify UI plug-in infrastructure to proceed with plug-in initialization.
api.ready();
