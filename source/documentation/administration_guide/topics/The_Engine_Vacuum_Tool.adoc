= The Engine Vacuum Tool

The Engine Vacuum tool maintains PostgreSQL databases by updating tables and removing dead rows, allowing disk space to be reused. See the link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-vacuum.html[PostgreSQL documentation] for information about the `VACUUM` command and its parameters.

The Engine Vacuum command is `engine-vacuum`. You must log in as the *root* user and provide the administration credentials for the {virt-product-fullname} environment.

Alternatively, the Engine Vacuum tool can be run while using the `engine-setup` command to customize an existing installation:

[options="nowrap" ]
----
$ engine-setup
...
[ INFO  ] Stage: Environment customization
...
Perform full vacuum on the engine database engine@localhost?
This operation may take a while depending on this setup health and the
configuration of the db vacuum process.
See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/sql-vacuum.html
(Yes, No) [No]:
----
The *Yes* option runs the Engine Vacuum tool in full vacuum verbose mode.
