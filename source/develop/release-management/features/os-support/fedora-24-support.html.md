# Fedora 24 Support

## Summary

Add support for Fedora 24

## Owner

*   Name: Sandro Bonazzola
*   Email: <sbonazzo@redhat.com>

## Detailed Description

*   Support building on Fedora 24
*   Create Jenkins jobs for automated build and testing on Fedora 24
*   Create Fedora 24 Jenkins slaves

oVirt is supporting Fedora as tech preview due to limited time resources.
Contribution toward having a better Fedora support are welcome.

## Benefit to oVirt

*   oVirt will be able to run on Fedora 24

## Dependencies / Related Features

## Testing

The whole test case collection should work on Fedora 24.

The Open Virtualization Manager (ovirt-engine) is ready to be tested.

Known Fedora 24 related bugs are tracked on [Fedora 24 Tracker bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1355626)

## Contingency Plan

The feature is self contained: if support for Fedora 24 won't be stable enough for 4.1.0 we won't deliver Fedora 24 RPMs.
