# Console settings dialog in Webadmin and User Portal

## Owner

*   Name: Frank Kobzik (Fkobzik)
*   Email: <fkobzik@redhat.com>

## Description/status

This feature has these aims:

*   to extract the console settings dialog from User Portal and use it in Webadmin as well - MERGED
*   to enhance this dialog with additional options that reflect recently added oVirt features, there are:
    -   [Features/Spice Proxy](/develop/release-management/features/virt/spice-proxy/) - DONE
    -   [Features/Display Address Override](/develop/release-management/features/virt/display-address-override/)
    -   [Features/Non plugin console invocation](/develop/release-management/features/virt/non-plugin-console-invocation/) - DONE
    -   [Features/noVNC console](/develop/release-management/features/virt/novnc-console/), [Features/SpiceHTML5](/develop/release-management/features/virt/spicehtml5/) - DONE
*   to make use of browser local storage to save configuration of the dialog per-VM - DONE

## Limitations

*   this feature will not allow changing console type from VNC to SPICE and vice versa (on running VM) as this affects the VM entity and requires VM restart

## Benefit to oVirt

This feature will allow quick changing of console parameters from frontend.

## Testing

### Mission 1 - Test dialog functionality

*   Create 2 VMs with SPICE and VNC display protocol, run them.
*   Open Console Option dialog for them and then try selecting various combinations of options for the dialog and then connect to VM .

### Mission 2 - Testing options persistence

*   Open Console Options dialog for a VM
*   Change some options, click OK
*   Refresh the browser window (to reinitialize gwt app)
*   Open Console Options dialog for that VM again
*   Check if previously selected options are selected now.
