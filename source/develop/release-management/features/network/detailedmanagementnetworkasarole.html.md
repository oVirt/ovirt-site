# Detailed Management Network As A Role

## Summary

This page describes the implementation details of the ["Management network as a role" feature](/develop/release-management/features/network/management-network-as-a-role/).

### Entity Description

*   No new entities
*   *Management* boolean field will be added to NetworkCluster entity. *True* value will indicate that the network is the management one in the given cluster (similarly like it been done for display networks).

## Installation/Upgrade

*   During the upgrade the new field (*is_management*) will be added to *NETWORK_CLUSTER* table and will be populated by *true* value for ovirtmgmt networks and *false* for all other networks.
*   The following DB objects will be updated with the new field:
    -   *NETWORK_CLUSTER_VIEW*
    -   Stored procedures:
        -   *GetAllNetworkByClusterId*
        -   *Insertnetwork_cluster*
        -   *Updatenetwork_cluster*
*   New stored procedure *set_network_exclusively_as_management* will be created
*   ManagementNetwork entry will be renamed in VDC_OPTIONS table to DefaultManagementNetwork.
    -   RenameManagementNetwork stored procedure will be updated accordingly.

## Planned code changes

### UI

The UI layer will be updated according to the [feature page](/develop/release-management/features/network/management-network-as-a-role/).

All places that refer to *ConfigurationValues.ManagementNetwork* value will be updated with the new logic:

*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.dataprovider.AsyncDataProvider
    -   getManagementNetworkName - is not in use currently. Pending removal.
    -   isNetworkManagementInAnyCluster(Network) - will be added.
    -   isManagementNetwork(Network, cluster) - will be added.
*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.datacenters.DataCenterNetworkListModel
*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.datacenters.NetworkModel
*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.hosts.HostInterfaceListModel.ENGINE_NETWORK_NAME - is not used in the class but is used by other classes:
    -   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.Linq.NetworkComparator - that is used by:
        -   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.SystemTreeModel
        -   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.clusters.ClusterNetworkListModel
        -   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.datacenters.DataCenterNetworkListModel
    -   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.clusters.ClusterNetworkModel
    -   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.hosts.HostSetupNetworksModel
    -   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.hosts.network.LogicalNetworkModel
*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.networks.NetworkGeneralModel
*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.networks.NetworkListModel
*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.vms.NewProfileBehavior
*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.models.vms.VmInterfaceModel.VmInterfaceModel.ENGINE_NETWORK_NAME - protected static class member is not in use, but is initialialized in the class constructor!!!
*   org.ovirt.engine.ui.webadmin.section.main.view.tab.MainTabNetworkView

### Backend

#### ManagementNetworkFinder

*ManagementNetworkFinder* class will be introduced. The class will implement heuristic logic of finding the management network either it was supplied by the user or not.

#### AddVdsGroupCommand

In addition to what it already does the class will determine what management network should be (using *ManagementNetworkFinder*) and will:

*   attach it to the new cluster
*   make it management and required

#### UpdateVdsGroupCommand

In the case when the management network is to be updated:

##### canDoAction

The following checks will be added:

*   the new management network is required
*   no hosts are attached to the cluster

##### executeCommand

Same as AddVdsGroupCommand

#### NetworkUtils

*isManagementNetwork* methods will be moved to a new *ManagementNetworkUtils* class that will reside in *bll* project. The new class will implement the following methods:

*   boolean isManagementNetwork(Guid networkId)
*   boolean isManagementNetwork(String networkName, Guid clusterId)
*   Network getManagementNetwork(Guid clusterId)

#### DAO

Optionally: a new *getManagementNetwork* method will be added to *NetworkClusterDao*

#### Command classes

The following classes will be affected by the feature:

*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.InstallVdsInternalCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.UpdateVdsGroupCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.VdsDeploy
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.NetworkConfigurator
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.cluster.UpdateNetworkOnClusterCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.dc.UpdateNetworkCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.host.AttachNetworkToVdsInterfaceCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.host.UpdateNetworkToVdsInterfaceCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.host.SetupNetworksHelper
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.RemoveNetworkParametersBuilder
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.cluster.AttachNetworkToVdsGroupCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.cluster.UpdateNetworkOnClusterCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.host.AddBondCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.storage.UpdateStoragePoolCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.validator.NetworkValidator
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.CollectVdsNetworkDataVDSCommand
*   org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.SetupNetworksVDSCommand

### Miscellaneous

ConfigValues.ManagementNetwork and ConfigurationValues.ManagementNetwork will be renamed to DefaultManagementNetwork.

## Events

According to the new validations.

## Open Issues

1.  ManagementNetworkUtils project - the right place for that kind of logic is *bll*. However, the logic is needed by *vdsbroker*, but *bll* is dependent on the earlier apparently. ðŸ˜ 
2.  UpdateVdsGroupCommand - when moving the cluster back into a DC, need to add its management network.

*   -   Which network should be assigned as the management one?
    -   What should be done with the host of the cluster?
