//{virt-product-fullname} Upgrade Overview

This guide explains how to upgrade the following environments to {virt-product-fullname} 4.3 or 4.4 :

* *Standalone manager, local database*: Both the Data Warehouse database and the {engine-name} database are installed on the {engine-name}.

* *Standalone manager, remote database*: Either the Data Warehouse database or the {engine-name} database, or both, are on a separate machine.

* *Self-hosted engine, local database*: Both the Data Warehouse database and the {engine-name} database are installed on the {engine-name}.

[NOTE]
====
For a checklist of upgrade instructions, you can use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/rhvupgradehelper/[RHV Upgrade Helper]. This application asks you to fill in a checklist for your upgrade path and current environment, and presents the applicable upgrade steps.

////
To save time when upgrading a {engine-name} with local databases, use the `ovirt-fast-forward-upgrade` tool.

[NOTE]
====
`ovirt-fast-forward-upgrade` supports local database environments only.
====

Alternatively, you can manually upgrade the {engine-name}. For remote database environments, this path is required.
////

[IMPORTANT]
====
Plan any necessary downtime in advance. After you update the clusters' compatibility versions during the upgrade, a new hardware configuration is automatically applied to each virtual machine once it reboots. You must reboot any running or suspended VMs as soon as possible to apply the configuration changes.
====

Select the appropriate instructions for your environment from the following table. If your {engine-name} and host versions differ (if you have previously upgraded the {engine-name} but not the hosts), follow the instructions that match the {engine-name}'s version.
