[id="Upgrading_the_Manager_to_4-3_{context}"]
= Upgrading the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} from 4.2 to 4.3

ifdef::4-2_remote_db[]
Follow these same steps when upgrading any of the following:

* the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}
* a remote machine with the Data Warehouse service
endif::4-2_remote_db[]

You need to be logged into the machine that you are upgrading.

// Included in:
// Upgrade Guide

// Although most of the {virt-product-fullname} doc set now uses `dnf` instead of `yum`, this topic still
// uses `yum` because it is included in 4.2 and 4.3 sections in the Upgrade Guide, where the OS is still
// {enterprise-linux} 7.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the upgrade fails, the `engine-setup` command attempts to restore your {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} installation to its previous state. For this reason, do not remove the previous version's repositories until after the upgrade is complete. If the upgrade fails, the `engine-setup` script explains how to restore your installation.
====

.Procedure

. Enable the {virt-product-fullname} 4.3 repositories:
+
ifdef::rhv-doc[]
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable=rhel-7-server-rhv-4.3-manager-rpms \
    --enable=jb-eap-7.2-for-rhel-7-server-rpms
----
endif::[]
ifdef::ovirt-doc[]
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# yum install https://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm
----
endif::[]
+
All other repositories remain the same across {virt-product-fullname} releases.

. Update the setup packages:
+
ifdef::rhv-doc[]
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# yum update ovirt\\*setup\* rh\*vm-setup-plugins
----
endif::[]
ifdef::ovirt-doc[]
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# yum update ovirt\\*setup\*
----
endif::[]

. Run `engine-setup` and follow the prompts to upgrade
ifndef::4-2_remote_db[]
the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}:
endif::4-2_remote_db[]
ifdef::4-2_remote_db[]
the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}, the remote database or remote service:
endif::4-2_remote_db[]
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# engine-setup
----
ifdef::4-2_remote_db[]
+
[NOTE]
====
During the upgrade process for the {engine-name}, the `engine-setup` script might prompt you to disconnect the remote Data Warehouse database. You must disconnect it to continue the setup.
====
endif::4-2_remote_db[]
+
When the script completes successfully, the following message appears:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
Execution of setup completed successfully
----

ifdef::rhv-doc[]
. Disable the {virt-product-fullname} 4.2 repositories to ensure the system does not use any 4.2 packages:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --disable=rhel-7-server-rhv-4.2-manager-rpms \
    --disable=jb-eap-7-for-rhel-7-server-rpms
----
endif::[]

. Update the base operating system:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# yum update
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you encounter a required Ansible package conflict during the update, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5480561[Cannot perform yum update on my RHV manager (ansible conflict)].
====
//ansible lock addition
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If any kernel packages were updated, reboot the machine to complete the upgrade.
====

The {engine-name} is now upgraded to version 4.3.

== Completing the remote Data Warehouse database upgrade

Complete these additional steps when upgrading a remote Data Warehouse database from PostgreSQL 9.5 to 10.

.Procedure

. The `ovirt-engine-dwhd` service is now running on the {engine-name} machine. If the `ovirt-engine-dwhd` service is on a remote machine, stop and disable the `ovirt-engine-dwhd` service on the {engine-name} machine, and remove the configuration files that `engine-setup` created:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# systemctl stop ovirt-engine-dwhd
# systemctl disable ovirt-engine-dwhd
# rm -f /etc/ovirt-engine-dwh/ovirt-engine-dwhd.conf.d/*
----

. Repeat the steps in xref:Upgrading_the_Manager_to_4-3_4-2_remote_db[Upgrading the {engine-name} to 4.3] on the machine hosting the `ovirt-engine-dwhd` service.
