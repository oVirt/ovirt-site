You must enable virtualization in the BIOS. Power off and reboot the host after this change to ensure that the change is applied.

. At the {enterprise-linux} or {hypervisor-fullname} boot screen, press any key and select the *Boot* or *Boot with serial console* entry from the list.
. Press `Tab` to edit the kernel parameters for the selected option.
. Ensure there is a space after the last kernel parameter listed, and append the parameter `rescue`.
. Press `Enter` to boot into rescue mode.

If any output is shown, the processor is hardware virtualization capable. If no output is shown, your processor may still support hardware virtualization; in some circumstances manufacturers disable the virtualization extensions in the BIOS. If you believe this to be the case, consult the system's BIOS and the motherboard manual provided by the manufacturer.
