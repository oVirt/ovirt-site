. Configure the SPM priority to be higher on all hosts in the primary site to ensure SPM failover to the secondary site occurs only when all hosts in the primary site are unavailable. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#SPM_Priority[SPM Priority] in the _Administration Guide_.

. Configure all virtual machines that need to failover as highly available, and ensure that the virtual machine has a lease on the target storage domain. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#Configuring_a_highly_available_virtual_machine[Configuring a Highly Available Virtual Machine] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.

. Configure virtual machine to host soft affinity and define the behavior you expect from the affinity group. See  link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#sect-Affinity_Groups[Affinity Groups] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_ and link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#sect-Scheduling_Policies[Scheduling Policies] in the _Administration Guide_.

The active-active failover can be manually performed by placing the main site's hosts into maintenance mode.
