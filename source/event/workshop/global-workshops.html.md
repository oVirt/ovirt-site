# OVirt Global Workshops

The purpose of this page is to document upcoming oVirt Workshops. oVirt Workshops are a community effort and will be held at both industry events and the campuses of oVirt Board Member companies. The community will target holding a workshop once every 2-3 months and cycling through each geographic region. This page will include schedule information, registration information and outstanding action items for developing each workshop.

If you are interested in setting up a workshop, please contact [Leslie Hawthorn](User:Lh).
