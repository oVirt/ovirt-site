==== Importing a Red Hat KVM Guest Image

You can import a Red Hat-provided KVM virtual machine image. This image is a virtual machine snapshot with a preconfigured instance of {enterprise-linux} installed.

You can configure this image with the *cloud-init* tool, and use it to provision new virtual machines. This eliminates the need to install and configure the operating system and provides virtual machines that are ready for use.


*Importing a Red Hat KVM Guest Image*

. Download the most recent KVM virtual machine image from the link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.5/x86_64/product-software[Download {enterprise-linux}] list, in the Product Software tab.
. Upload the virtual machine image using the {engine-name} or the REST API. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}administration_guide/#Uploading_a_Disk_Image_to_a_Storage_Domain[Uploading a Disk Image to a Storage Domain] in the _Administration Guide_.
. Create a new virtual machine and attach the uploaded disk image to it. See xref:Creating_a_virtual_machine_linux_vm[].
. Optionally, use *cloud-init* to configure the virtual machine. See xref:Using_Cloud-Init_to_Automate_the_Configuration_of_Virtual_Machines[] for details.
. Optionally, create a template from the virtual machine. You can generate new virtual machines from this template. See xref:chap-Templates[] for information about creating templates and generating virtual machines from templates.
