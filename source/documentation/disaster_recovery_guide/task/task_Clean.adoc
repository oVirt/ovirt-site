=== Clean the Primary Site

After you fail over, you must clean the environment in the primary site before failing back to it:

* Reboot all hosts in the primary site.
* Ensure the secondary site's storage domains are in read/write mode and the primary site's storage domains are in read only mode.
* Synchronize the replication from the secondary site's storage domains to the primary site's storage domains.  
* Clean the primary site of all storage domains to be imported. This can be done manually in the {engine-name}, or by creating and running an Ansible playbook. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}administration_guide/#Detaching_a_storage_domain[Detaching a Storage Domain] in the _Administration Guide_ for manual instructions, or <<create_cleanup>> for information to create the Ansible playbook.

This example uses the `dr-cleanup.yml` playbook created earlier to clean the environment.

*Cleaning the primary site:*

Clean up the primary site with the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# ansible-playbook dr-cleanup.yml --tags "clean_engine"
----

You can now failback the environment to the primary site. See <<execute_failback>> for more information.
