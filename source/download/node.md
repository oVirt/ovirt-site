# oVirt Node

oVirt Node is a minimal operating system based on CentOS that is designed to provide a simple method for setting up a
physical machine to act as a hypervisor in an oVirt environment. The minimal operating system contains only the packages
required for the machine to act as a hypervisor, and features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host and
performing administrative tasks.

## Installing oVirt Node

Before you start installing oVirt Node be sure to meet requirements on your virtualization host, see
[Host Requirements](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/#host-requirements) in the
[Installing oVirt as a self-hosted engine using the command line](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/) guide.

<!--- You should also check your workstation has a supported web browser for using cockpit, see [http://cockpit-project.org/running.html](http://cockpit-project.org/running.html)
for the minimum browser requirements. --->

Once ready, see
[oVirt Nodes](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/#Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SHE_cli_deploy) in the
[Installing oVirt as a self-hosted engine using the command line](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/)
guide for installation instructions.
