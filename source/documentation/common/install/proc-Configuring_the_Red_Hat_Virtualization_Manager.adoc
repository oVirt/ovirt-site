= Installing and Configuring the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}

Install the package and dependencies for the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}, and configure it using the `engine-setup` command. The script asks you a series of questions and, after you provide the required values for all questions, applies that configuration and starts the `ovirt-engine` service.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `engine-setup` command guides you through several distinct configuration stages, each comprising several steps that require user input. Suggested configuration defaults are provided in square brackets; if the suggested value is acceptable for a given step, press `Enter` to accept that value.

You can run `engine-setup --accept-defaults` to automatically accept all questions that have default answers. This option should be used with caution and only if you are familiar with `engine-setup`.

. The `engine-setup` command checks your firewall configuration and offers to open the ports used by the {engine-name} for external communication, such as ports 80 and 443. If you do not allow `engine-setup` to modify your firewall configuration, you must manually open the ports used by the {engine-name}. `firewalld` is configured as the firewall manager; `iptables` is deprecated.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Setup can automatically configure the firewall on this system.
Note: automatic configuration of the firewall may overwrite current settings.
NOTICE: iptables is deprecated and will be removed in future releases
Do you want Setup to configure the firewall? (Yes, No) [Yes]:
----

+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Where is the DWH database located? (Local, Remote) [Local]:
----

** If you select `Local`, the `engine-setup` script can configure your database automatically (including adding a user and a database), or it can connect to a preconfigured local database:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Setup can configure the local postgresql server automatically for the DWH to run. This may conflict with existing applications.
Would you like Setup to automatically configure postgresql and create DWH database, or prefer to perform that manually? (Automatic, Manual) [Automatic]:
----
+
*** If you select `Automatic` by pressing `Enter`, no further action is required here.
*** If you select `Manual`, input the following values for the manually configured local database:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]

. Select *Gluster*, *Virt*, or *Both*:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Application mode (Both, Virt, Gluster) [Both]:
----
*Both* offers the greatest flexibility. In most cases, select `Both`. *Virt* allows you to run virtual machines in the environment; *Gluster* only allows you to manage GlusterFS from the Administration Portal.

. If you installed the OVN provider, you can choose to use the default credentials, or specify an alternative.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----

. The {engine-name} uses certificates to communicate securely with its hosts. This certificate can also optionally be used to secure HTTPS communications with the {engine-name}. Provide the organization name for the certificate:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Organization name for certificate [_autodetected domain-based name_]:
----

. Optionally allow `engine-setup` to make the landing page of the {engine-name} the default page presented by the Apache web server:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Setup can configure the default page of the web server to present the application home page. This may conflict with existing applications.
Do you wish to set the application as the default web page of the server? (Yes, No) [Yes]:
----

. By default, external SSL (HTTPS) communication with the {engine-name} is secured with the self-signed certificate created earlier in the configuration to securely communicate with hosts. Alternatively, choose another certificate for external HTTPS connections; this does not affect how the {engine-name} communicates with hosts:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Setup can configure apache to use SSL using a certificate issued from the internal CA.
Do you wish Setup to configure that, or prefer to perform that manually? (Automatic, Manual) [Automatic]:
----
+
ifdef::SM_localDB_deploy[]
//Only appears if you answer Yes to installing DWH on the {engine-name} machine
. Choose how long Data Warehouse will retain collected data:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Please choose Data Warehouse sampling scale:
(1) Basic
(2) Full
(1, 2)[1]:
----
`Full` uses the default values for the data storage settings listed in the link:{URL_virt_product_docs}data-warehouse/Data_Warehouse_Guide.html#Application_Settings_for_the_Data_Warehouse_service_in_ovirt-engine-dwhd_file[_Data Warehouse Guide_] (recommended when Data Warehouse is installed on a remote server).
+
`Basic` reduces the values of `DWH_TABLES_KEEP_HOURLY` to `720` and `DWH_TABLES_KEEP_DAILY` to `0`, easing the load on the {engine-name} machine. Use `Basic` when the {engine-name} and Data Warehouse are installed on the same machine.
endif::SM_localDB_deploy[]
. Review the installation settings, and press `Enter` to accept the values and proceed with the installation:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Please confirm installation settings (OK, Cancel) [OK]:
----

+
When your environment has been configured, `engine-setup` displays details about how to access your environment. If you chose to manually configure the firewall, `engine-setup` provides a custom list of ports that need to be opened, based on the options selected during setup. `engine-setup` also saves your answers to a file that can be used to reconfigure the {engine-name} using the same values, and outputs the location of the log file for the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} configuration process.

. If you intend to link your {virt-product-fullname} environment with a directory server, configure the date and time to synchronize with the system clock used by the directory server to avoid unexpected account expiry issues. See link:{URL_rhel_docs_legacy}html/System_Administrators_Guide/chap-Configuring_the_Date_and_Time.html#sect-Configuring_the_Date_and_Time-timedatectl-NTP[Synchronizing the System Clock with a Remote Server] in the _{enterprise-linux} System Administrator's Guide_ for more information.

. Install the certificate authority according to the instructions provided by your browser. You can get the certificate authority's certificate by navigating to `http://_manager-fqdn_/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&amp;format=X509-PEM-CA`, replacing _manager-fqdn_ with the FQDN that you provided during the installation.
