==== Syntax for the engine-vacuum Command

The basic syntax for the `engine-vacuum` command is:
	
[source,terminal]
----
# engine-vacuum
----
	
[source,terminal]
----
# engine-vacuum _option_
----

Running the `engine-vacuum` command with no options performs a standard vacuum.

There are several parameters to further refine the `engine-vacuum` command.

*General Options*

*`-h` `--help`*:: Displays information on how to use the `engine-vacuum` command.


*`-a`*:: Runs a standard vacuum, analyzes the database, and updates the optimizer statistics.


*`-A`*:: Analyzes the database and updates the optimizer statistics, without vacuuming.


*`-f`*:: Runs a full vacuum.


*`-v`*:: Runs in verbose mode, providing more console output.


*`-t _table_name_`*:: Vacuums a specific table or tables.
