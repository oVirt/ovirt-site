= RHV for IBM Power

This release supports {enterprise-linux} 8 hosts on IBM POWER8 little endian hardware and {enterprise-linux} 7 and 8 virtual machines on emulated IBM POWER8 hardware. From {virt-product-fullname} 4.2.6 {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s are supported on IBM POWER9 little endian hardware and {enterprise-linux} 8 virtual machines on emulated IBM POWER9 hardware.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Previous releases of RHV for IBM Power required {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s on POWER8 hardware to be installed from an ISO image. These hosts cannot be updated for use with this release. You must reinstall {enterprise-linux} 8 hosts using the repositories outlined below.
====
The packages provided in the following repositories are required to install and configure aspects of a {virt-product-fullname} environment on POWER8 hardware.

[NOTE]
====
If the virtual machine fails to boot on IBM POWER9, it might be because of the risk level setting on your firmware. To resolve this issue, see the Troubleshooting scenarios in  link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#Powering_on_a_virtual_machine[Starting a virtual machine].
