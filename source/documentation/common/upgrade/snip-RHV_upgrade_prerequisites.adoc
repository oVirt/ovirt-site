* Plan for any necessary virtual machine downtime. After you update the clusters' compatibility versions during the upgrade, a new hardware configuration is automatically applied to each virtual machine once it reboots. You must reboot any running or suspended virtual machines as soon as possible to apply the configuration changes.

// This link must always be the latest version.
* Ensure your environment meets the requirements for {virt-product-fullname} {vernum_rhv}. For a complete list of prerequisites, see the link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}planning_and_prerequisites_guide/index#RHV_requirements[__Planning and Prerequisites Guide__].

* When upgrading {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}, it is recommended that you use one of the existing hosts. If you decide to use a new host, you must assign a unique name to the new host and then add it to the existing cluster before you begin the upgrade procedure.

* Ensure the {engine-name} has the correct repositories enabled for each stage of the process, whether  updating to the latest release of the current version, or upgrading to the next version.

// The {engine-name} repo requirement is appended to the end of this list in each assembly, because it must be the starting version, and would therefore require a lot of ifdefs to include it here.
