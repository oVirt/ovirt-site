= Adding Self-Hosted Engine Nodes to the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}

Self-hosted engine nodes are added in the same way as a standard host, with an additional step to deploy the host as a self-hosted engine node. The shared storage domain is automatically detected and the node can be used as a failover host to host the {engine-name} virtual machine when required. You can also attach standard hosts to a self-hosted engine environment, but they cannot host the {engine-name} virtual machine. Have at least two self-hosted engine nodes to ensure the {engine-name} virtual machine is highly available. Additional hosts can also be added using the REST API. See link:http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-engine-api-model/4.3#services/hosts[Hosts] in the _REST API Guide_.

.Prerequisites

* If you are reusing a self-hosted engine node, remove its existing self-hosted engine configuration. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}admin-guide/administration-guide.html[Removing a Host from a Self-Hosted Engine Environment].

.Procedure

. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts].

. Click btn:[New].
+
For information on additional host settings, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}admin-guide/administration-guide.html#sect-Explanation_of_Settings_and_Controls_in_the_New_Host_and_Edit_Host_Windows[Explanation of Settings and Controls in the New Host and Edit Host Windows] in the _Administration Guide_.

. Use the drop-down list to select the *Data Center* and *Host Cluster* for the new host.

. Enter the *Name* and the *Address* of the new host. The standard SSH port, port 22, is auto-filled in the *SSH Port* field.

. Select an authentication method to use for the {engine-name} to access the host.

** Enter the root user's password to use password authentication.

** Alternatively, copy the key displayed in the *SSH PublicKey* field to */root/.ssh/authorized_keys* on the host to use public key authentication.

. Optionally, configure power management, where the host has a supported power management card. For information on power management configuration, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}admin-guide/administration-guide.html#Host_Power_Management_settings_explained[Host Power Management Settings Explained] in the _Administration Guide_.

. Click the *Hosted Engine* tab.

. Select *Deploy*.

. Click btn:[OK].
