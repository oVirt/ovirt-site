# Localization Mini-Howto

This is a short howto on localizing the ovirt engine user interface.
The intended primary audience for this howto is translators:

1. Create an account on [Weblate](https://translate.ovirt.tech/)
2. Login and select for which project you want to add translations.
3. Select your language and select the component you want to add translations to.
4. Start translating either by choosing a certain string through the Browse button or go through the whole component string by string using the Translate button.
5. See the list of languages being translated with Weblate [oVirt project](https://translate.ovirt.tech/languages/)
6. If the language you want to translate is not yet included in the project, please ask for it to be added by sending an email to `devel@ovirt.org`.
7. Check known localization [bugzilla issues](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=classification%3Aovirt%20cf_ovirt_team%3Ai18n)
   and [Github issues](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Aovirt+label%3Ai18n)
