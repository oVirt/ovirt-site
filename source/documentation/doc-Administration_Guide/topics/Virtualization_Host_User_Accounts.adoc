[[Virtualization_Host_User_Accounts]]
==== Virtualization Host User Accounts


A number of system user accounts are created on the virtualization host when the `vdsm` and `qemu-kvm-rhev` packages are installed. Each system user has a default user identifier (UID). The system user accounts created are:

* The *vdsm* user (UID `36`).

* The *qemu* user (UID `107`).

* The *sanlock* user (UID `179`).

* The *ovirt-vmconsole* user (UID `498`).


[IMPORTANT]
====
The user identifiers (UIDs) and group identifiers (GIDs) allocated may vary between systems. The *vdsm* user is fixed to a UID of `36` and the *kvm* group is fixed to a GID of `36`.

If UID `36` or GID `36` is already used by another account on the system a conflict will arise during installation of the `vdsm` and `qemu-kvm-rhev` packages.
