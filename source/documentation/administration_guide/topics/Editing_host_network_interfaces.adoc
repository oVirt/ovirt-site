==== Editing Host Network Interfaces and Assigning Logical Networks to Hosts

You can change the settings of physical host network interfaces, move the management network from one physical host network interface to another, and assign logical networks to physical host network interfaces. Bridge and ethtool custom properties are also supported.

[WARNING]
====
The only way to change the IP address of a host in {virt-product-fullname} is to remove the host and then to add it again.

To change the VLAN settings of a host, see xref:Editing-VLAN-Settings[].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot assign logical networks offered by external providers to physical host network interfaces; such networks are dynamically assigned to hosts as they are required by virtual machines.
====

[NOTE]
====
If the switch has been configured to provide Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) information, you can hover your cursor over a physical network interface to view the switch port's current configuration. This can help to prevent incorrect configuration. Check the following information prior to assigning logical networks:

* *Port Description (TLV type 4)* and *System Name (TLV type 5)* help to detect to which ports and on which switch the host's interfaces are
patched.
* *Port VLAN ID* shows the native
VLAN ID configured on the switch port for untagged ethernet frames. All
VLANs configured on the switch port are shown as *VLAN Name* and *VLAN ID*
combinations.

[[Editing_Host_Network_Interfaces_and_Assigning_Logical_Networks_to_Hosts]]
*Editing Host Network Interfaces and Assigning Logical Networks to Hosts*

. Click menu:Compute[Hosts].
. Click the host's name to open the details view.
. Click the *Network Interfaces* tab.
. Click *Setup Host Networks*.
. Optionally, hover your cursor over host network interface to view configuration information provided by the switch.
. Attach a logical network to a physical host network interface by selecting and dragging the logical network into the *Assigned Logical Networks* area next to the physical host network interface.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a NIC is connected to more than one logical network, only one of the networks can be non-VLAN. All the other logical networks must be unique VLANs.
====

. Configure the logical network:
.. Hover your cursor over an assigned logical network and click the pencil icon to open the *Edit Management Network* window.
.. From the *IPv4* tab, select a *Boot Protocol* from *None*, *DHCP*, or *Static*. If you selected *Static*, enter the *IP*, *Netmask / Routing Prefix*, and the *Gateway*.
+
[NOTE]
====
For IPv6, only static IPv6 addressing is supported.
To configure the logical network, select the *IPv6* tab and make the following entries:

* Set *Boot Protocol* to *Static*.
* For *Routing Prefix*, enter the _length_ of the prefix using a forward slash and decimals. For example: `/48`
* *IP*: The complete IPv6 address of the host network interface. For example: `2001:db8::1:0:0:6`
* *Gateway*: The source router's IPv6 address. For example: `2001:db8::1:0:0:1`
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If you change the host's management network IP address, you must xref:Reinstalling_Hosts_admin[reinstall the host] for the new IP address to be configured.

Each logical network can have a separate gateway defined from the management network gateway. This ensures traffic that arrives on the logical network will be forwarded using the logical network's gateway instead of the default gateway used by the management network.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Set *all* hosts in a cluster to use the same IP stack for their management network; either IPv4 or IPv6 only. Dual stack is not supported.
====
+
.. Use the *QoS* tab to override the default host network quality of service. Select *Override QoS* and enter the desired values in the following fields:

* *Weighted Share*: Signifies how much of the logical link's capacity a specific network should be allocated, relative to the other networks attached to the same logical link. The exact share depends on the sum of shares of all networks on that link. By default this is a number in the range 1-100.

* *Rate Limit [Mbps]*: The maximum bandwidth to be used by a network.

* *Committed Rate [Mbps]*: The minimum bandwidth required by a network. The Committed Rate requested is not guaranteed and will vary depending on the network infrastructure and the Committed Rate requested by other networks on the same logical link.

.. To configure a network bridge, click the *Custom Properties* tab and select *bridge_opts* from the drop-down list. Enter a valid key and value with the following syntax: _key_=_value_. Separate multiple entries with a whitespace character. The following keys are valid, with the values provided as examples. For more information on these parameters, see xref:Explanation_of_bridge_opts_Parameters[].

.. To configure ethernet properties, click the *Custom Properties* tab and select *ethtool_opts* from the drop-down list. Enter a valid value using the format of the command-line arguments of ethtool. For example:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
--coalesce em1 rx-usecs 14 sample-interval 3 --offload em2 rx on lro on tso off --change em1 speed 1000 duplex half
----
This field can accept wildcards. For example, to apply the same option to all of this network's interfaces, use:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
--coalesce * rx-usecs 14 sample-interval 3
----
The *ethtool_opts* option is not available by default; you need to add it using the engine configuration tool. See xref:How_to_Set_Up_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_Manager_to_Use_Ethtool[] for more information. For more information on ethtool properties, see the manual page by typing `man ethtool` in the command line.
.. To configure Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), click the *Custom Properties* tab and select *fcoe* from the drop-down list. Enter a valid key and value with the following syntax: _key_=_value_. At least `enable=yes` is required. You can also add `dcb=`[yes|no]`` and `auto_vlan=`[yes|no]``. Separate multiple entries with a whitespace character. The *fcoe* option is not available by default; you need to add it using the engine configuration tool. See xref:How_to_Set_Up_RHVM_to_Use_FCoE[] for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
A separate, dedicated logical network is recommended for use with FCoE.
====
+
.. To change the default network used by the host from the management network (ovirtmgmt) to a non-management network, configure the non-management network's default route. See xref:Configuring_a_Default_Route[] for more information.

.. If your logical network definition is not synchronized with the network configuration on the host, select the *Sync network* check box. For more information about unsynchronized hosts and how to synchronize them, see xref:Synchronizing_host_networks[].
+
. Select the *Verify connectivity between Host and Engine* check box to check network connectivity. This action only works if the host is in maintenance mode.
. Click *OK*.

[NOTE]
====
If not all network interface cards for the host are displayed, click menu:Management[Refresh Capabilities] to update the list of network interface cards available for that host.
