# oVirt 4.0.5 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 4.0.5
Release as of November 15th, 2016.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, and provides an awesome
KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2, CentOS Linux 7.2 (or similar).

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases,
check out the [previous versions release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/).

An updated documentation has been provided by our downstream 
[Red Hat Virtualization](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization?version=4.0/)


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

Users upgrading from 3.6 should be aware of following 4.0 changes around
authentication and certificates handling:

1. Single Sign-On using OAUTH2 protocol has been implemented in engine to
   allow SSO between webadmin, userportal and RESTAPI. More information can
   be found at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1092744

2. Due to SSO it's required to access engine only using the same FQDN which
   was specified during engine-setup invocation. If your engine FQDN is not
   accessible from all engine clients, you will not be able to login. Please
   use ovirt-engine-rename tool to fix your FQDN, more information can be
   found at https://www.ovirt.org/documentation/how-to/networking/changing-engine-hostname/ .
   If you try to access engine using IP or DNS alias, an error will be
   thrown. Please consult following bugs targeted to oVirt 4.0.4 which
   should fix this limitation:
     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1325746
     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1362196

3. If you have used Kerberos SSO to access engine, please consult
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1342192 how to update your Apache
   configuration after upgrade to 4.0

4. If you are using HTTPS certificate signed by custom certificate
   authority, please take a look at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1336838
   for steps which need to be done after migration to 4.0. Also please
   consult https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1313379 how to setup this custom
   CA for use with virt-viewer clients.



### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm)

and then follow documentation from our downstream
[Red Hat Virtualization](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/)

If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
      # engine-setup

Upgrade on Fedora 22 and Enterprise Linux 6 is not supported and you should follow our [Migration Guide](../../documentation/migration-engine-36-to-40/) in order to migrate to Enterprise Linux 7 or Fedora 23.

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install) guide or the
corresponding Red Hat Virtualization [Self Hosted Engine Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/paged/self-hosted-engine-guide/)

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine) guide
or the corresponding Red Hat Virtualization [Upgrade Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/paged/upgrade-guide/)

## Known issues

 - [BZ 1297835](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1297835) <b>Host install fails on Fedora 23 due to lack of dep on python2-dnf</b><br>On Fedora >= 23 dnf package manager with python 3 is used by default while
ovirt-host-deploy is executed by ovirt-engine using python2. This cause Host install to fail on Fedora >= 23 due to lack of python2-dnf in the default environment. As workaround please install manually python2-dnf on the host before trying to add it to the engine.


## What's New in 4.0.5?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

##### Team: Integration

 - [BZ 1340810](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1340810) <b>4.0 engine-backup should hide reports backup/restore</b><br>Feature: <br><br>engine-backup --mode=restore does not restore reports db/conf even if found in backup.<br><br>Reason: <br><br>In 4.0 Reports is not packaged/supported anymore. engine-backup of 4.0 supports restoring a 3.6 backup, which might include Reports data.<br><br>Result: <br><br>If Reports db dump is found in a backup, engine-backup notifies the user that it will not be restored, and does not restore Reports db/conf.

##### Team: Virt

 - [BZ 1346847](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1346847) <b>virt-v2v basic REST API</b><br>With this update, the ability to import virtual machines from VMware, VMware OVA, XEN, and KVM via the Red Hat Virtualization REST API has been added. Previously, this was only possible using the web UI.

#### VDSM

##### Team: SLA

 - [BZ 1373832](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1373832) <b>Add all APIs needed to support jsonrpc in MOM</b><br>The Memory Overcommit Manager (MoM) can now use JSONRPC insead of XMLRPC for communication with the VDSM.

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

##### Team: Integration

 - [BZ 1347340](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1347340) <b>[RFE] hosted engine should check the actual size of the qcow instead of relying on the OVA</b><br>Previously, ovirt-hosted-engine-setup relied on the OVA metadata to determine the size of the image contained in OVAs, and the amount of temporary disk space needed to unpack it. However, sparsified images would report a value much higher than the actual space required on-disk. Now, ovirt-hosted-engine-setup will check the actual size of images contained in OVAs in order to determine the amount of temporary storage required.
 - [BZ 1343451](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1343451) <b>upgrade-appliance should warn about sshd keys changes</b><br>During the migration of the hosted-engine VM from 3.6/el6 to 4.0/el7, hosted-engine-setup is going to deploy a new appliance and so the ssh keys are going to be regenerated.<br>So the user has to remove previous entries from know_hosts on his clients.

#### oVirt Host Deploy

##### Team: Network

 - [BZ 1373968](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1373968) <b>Deploying a host with an external Neutron network configured fails</b><br>Previously, with the release of OpenStack Liberty the Open vSwitch agent ini file location changed. This caused host deployment to fail when the latest releases of OpenStack were used. Now, support for Liberty and newer releases of OpenStack has been added and host deployment no longer fails.

#### MOM

##### Team: SLA

 - [BZ 1366556](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1366556) <b>MOM causes Vdsm to slow down, high number of 'vmGetIoTunePolicy' API calls</b><br>This update ensures that the Memory Overcommit Manager (MoM) uses just one request to retrieve the ioTune configuration and status. This retrieval is more efficient and lowers the load imposed on the VDSM.<br><br>Previously one request per virtual machine was made which caused a high load on the VDSM.

#### oVirt Engine Extension AAA LDAP

##### Team: Infra

 - [BZ 1388083](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1388083) <b>Use mod_auth_gssapi and mod_session instead of mod_auth_kerb for Kerberos SSO</b><br>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 used mod_auth_kerb to setup Kerberos SSO, but this module has been deprecated; mod_auth_gssapi is used instead. This update ensures mod_auth_gssapi and mod_session is used, and that example configurations have been updated.<br><br>For existing customers, mod_auth_kerb will continue to work with previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

### Rebase: Bug Fixes and Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

##### Team: Infra

 - [BZ 1368985](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1368985) <b>[RFE] Rebase on wildfly-10.1.0</b><br>Rebase package(s) to version: 10.1.0<br><br>Highlights, important fixes, or notable enhancements: <br>See Wildfly 10.1.0 release notes: http://wildfly.org/news/2016/08/19/WildFly10-1-Released/
