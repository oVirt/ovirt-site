# Using Tags to Customize Interactions with Red Hat Virtualization

After your Red Hat Virtualization platform is set up and configured to your requirements, you can customize the way you work with it using tags. Tags provide one key advantage to system administrators: they allow system resources to be arranged into groups or categories. This is useful when many objects exist in the virtualization environment and the administrator would like to concentrate on a specific set of them.

This section describes how to create and edit tags, assign them to hosts or virtual machines and search using the tags as criteria. Tags can be arranged in a hierarchy that matches a structure, to fit the needs of the enterprise.

Administration Portal Tags can be created, modified, and removed using the **Tags** pane.
