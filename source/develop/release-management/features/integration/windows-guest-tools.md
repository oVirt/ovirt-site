## Detailed Description

The oVirt Guest Tool ISO provides a collection of tools usable for Windows VMs that run under KVM (oVirt).
It also includes an installer  to make the tools installation as easy as possible.

The oVirt Guest Tools Installer installs all VirtIO-Win device drivers (Balloon, Serial, Net, Block and SCSI)
along with Spice Agent and QXL drivers.

Compatibility matrix:

| OS      | VirtIO-Win drivers | oVirt Agent | Spice Agent | Installer | QXL |
| XP      |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 2K3     |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |   |
| 2K8     |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Win 7   |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 2K8R2   |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Win 8   |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |   |
| 2K12    |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |   |
| Win 8.1 |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |   |
| 2K12R2  |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |   |
| Win 10  |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 2K16    |  ✓ |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |   |

QXL support is also declared on [Download](/download) page and should be kept in sync with above matrix.

The installer is based on the Spice installer's source code (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~teuf/spice-nsis/) ,
and was slightly modifed for this project's needs.

**Important Note!** [Bug 1528652](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1528652) Currently you can't directly upgrade between the versions without either first stopping the services or performing an uninstall.

The current list of the software to be included in the ISO:

* VirtIO-Win drivers:
  * VirtIO-Serial
  * VirtIO-Balloon
  * VirtIO-Net
  * VirtIO-Block
  * VirtIO-SCSI From:

* Spice drivers and agent

  **Important Note!** It seems that Spice installer (current is [spice-guest-tools-0.132.exe](https://www.spice-space.org/download/binaries/spice-guest-tools/spice-guest-tools-0.132/spice-guest-tools-0.132.exe) ) installs not just Spice related components (QXL and Agent), but all VirtIO-Win drivers as well.

* Spice QXL for 32 and 64 bit Windows
* Qemu Guest Agent
* oVirt Guest Agent (Currently it is cross-compiled using Wine)

## Benefit to oVirt

The ISO image will become a central repository for all the software that Windows based VMs require
in order to function in most optimal way under oVirt / KVM.
