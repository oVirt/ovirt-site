[[Bonding_Methods]]

Network bonding combines multiple NICs into a bond device, with the following advantages:

* The transmission speed of bonded NICs is greater than that of a single NIC.

* Network bonding provides fault tolerance, because the bond device will not fail unless all its NICs fail.

Using NICs of the same make and model ensures that they support the same bonding options and modes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{virt-product-fullname}'s default bonding mode, `(Mode 4) Dynamic Link Aggregation`, requires a switch that supports 802.3ad.
[[Bond_logical_networks_compatibility]]
The logical networks of a bond must be compatible. A bond can support only 1 non-VLAN logical network. The rest of the logical networks must have unique VLAN IDs.

Bonding must be enabled for the switch ports. Consult the manual provided by your switch vendor for specific instructions.

You can create a network bond device using one of the following methods:

* Manually, in the xref:Creating_a_bond_device_in_the_administration_portal[Administration Portal], for a specific host

* Automatically, using xref:Creating_a_bond_device_with_the_lldp_labeler_service[LLDP Labeler], for unbonded NICs of all hosts in a cluster or data center

If your environment uses iSCSI storage and you want to implement redundancy, follow the instructions for xref:Configuring_iSCSI_Multipathing[configuring iSCSI multipathing].
