# yum install ovirt-ansible-roles

By default the roles are installed to */usr/share/ansible/roles*. The structure of the `ovirt-ansible-roles` package is as follows:

* */usr/share/ansible/roles* - stores the roles.

* */usr/share/doc/ovirt-ansible-roles/* - stores the examples, a basic overview, and the licence.

* */usr/share/doc/ansible/roles/_role_name_* - stores the documentation specific to the role.
