# Reporting a bug

## Creating a Bugzilla account

If you do not yet have one, you will need to create an account on [Red Hat's bugzilla service](http://bugzilla.redhat.com). Here's how.

1.  Follow the ["Create a new account"](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi) link here, or on any page (such as the new bug page) which asks you for a login and password.
2.  Enter your email address when requested. Bugzilla accounts require a verified email address so that developers can ask questions about your bug report to ensure they get fixed.
3.  Follow the instructions in the email you receive. You can either click a link in the email, or copy and paste the URL into your web browser. In the resulting page, enter your real name, and enter and confirm your password.

Congratulations, you have a bugzilla account! You can now [create a new bug against the oVirt project](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=ovirt).

## Creating a new bug

To report a bug against oVirt:

1.  Click on [the "New" link](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi) in Red Hat bugzilla, and choose ["oVirt"](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt) from the classification list.
2.  Choose the appropriate component to report your bug - for a problem with the management application, choose "ovirt-engine-core". If you are unsure, hazard a guess, the component will be appropriately set after your report is evaluated by a developer later.
3.  If you know which version of the project you are using, choose it from the "Version" box.
4.  In the "Summary" field, enter a short description of the problem. For example, "Cannot connect to virtual machines using Console"

*   In the "Description" field, you may choose to follow the template provided, entering a more detailed description of your server configuration, and your expected and observed results.

All other fields can be left at their default value. Click the "Submit bug" button, and you're done! Congratulations, you've reported a bug against oVirt.
