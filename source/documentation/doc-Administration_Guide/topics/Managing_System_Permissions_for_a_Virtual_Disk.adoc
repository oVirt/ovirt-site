==== Managing System Permissions for a Virtual Disk

As the *SuperUser*, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a *DataCenterAdmin* role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a *ClusterAdmin* has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.

{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} provides two default virtual disk user roles, but no default virtual disk administrator roles. One of these user roles, the *DiskCreator* role, enables the administration of virtual disks from the VM Portal. This role can be applied to specific virtual machines, to a data center, to a specific storage domain, or to the whole virtualized environment; this is useful to allow different users to manage different virtual resources.

The virtual disk creator role permits the following actions:

* Create, edit, and remove virtual disks associated with a virtual machine or other resources.

* Edit user permissions for virtual disks.



[NOTE]
====
You can only assign roles and permissions to existing users.
