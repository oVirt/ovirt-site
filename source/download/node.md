# oVirt Node

oVirt Node is a minimal operating system based on CentOS that is designed to provide a simple method for setting up a
physical machine to act as a hypervisor in an oVirt environment. The minimal operating system contains only the packages
required for the machine to act as a hypervisor, and features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host and
performing administrative tasks.

Due to this minimalistic approach, oVirt Node NG is not recommended if you need to customize the configuration of
your virtualization hosts with multiple additional packages or third party software.

## Installing oVirt Node

Before you start installing oVirt Node be sure to meet requirements on your virtualization host, see
[Host Requirements](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/#host-requirements) in the
[Installing oVirt as a self-hosted engine using the command line](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/) guide.

Once ready, see
[oVirt Nodes](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/#Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SHE_cli_deploy) in the
[Installing oVirt as a self-hosted engine using the command line](/documentation/installing_ovirt_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/)
guide for installation instructions.
