==== Creating a New Logical Network in a Data Center or Cluster

Create a logical network and define its use in a data center, or in clusters in a data center.

*Creating a New Logical Network in a Data Center or Cluster*

. Click menu:Compute[Data Centers] or menu:Compute[Clusters].
. Click the data center or cluster name. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Logical Networks* tab.
. Open the *New Logical Network* window:
* From a data center details view, click *New*.
* From a cluster details view, click *Add Network*.
. Enter a *Name*, *Description*, and *Comment* for the logical network.
. Optionally, enable *Enable VLAN tagging*.
. Optionally, disable *VM Network*.
. Optionally, select the *Create on external provider* check box. This disables the *Network Label*, *VM Network*, and *MTU* options. See xref:chap-External_Providers[] for details.

. Select the *External Provider*. The *External Provider* list does not include external providers that are in `read-only` mode.
+
You can create an internal, isolated network, by selecting *ovirt-provider-ovn* on the *External Provider* list and leaving *Connect to physical network* unselected.

. Enter a new label or select an existing label for the logical network in the *Network Label* text field.
. For *MTU*, either select *Default (1500)* or select *Custom* and specify a custom value.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you change the network’s *MTU* settings, you must propagate this change to the running virtual machines on the network: Hot unplug and replug every virtual machine’s vNIC that should apply the MTU setting, or restart the virtual machines. Otherwise, these interfaces fail when the virtual machine migrates to another host. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4540631[] and link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1766414[BZ#1766414].
====
. If you selected *ovirt-provider-ovn* from the *External Provider* drop-down list, define whether the network should implement *Security Groups*. See xref:Logical_Network_General_Settings_Explained[] for details.
. From the *Cluster* tab, select the clusters to which the network will be assigned. You can also specify whether the logical network will be a required network.
. If *Create on external provider* is selected, the *Subnet* tab will be visible. From the *Subnet* tab, select the *Create subnet* and enter a *Name*, *CIDR*, and *Gateway* address, and select an *IP Version* for the subnet that the logical network will provide. You can also add DNS servers as required.
. From the *vNIC Profiles* tab, add vNIC profiles to the logical network as required.
. Click btn:[OK].

If you entered a label for the logical network, it is automatically added to all host network interfaces with that label.

[NOTE]
====
When creating a new logical network or making changes to an existing logical network that is used as a display network, any running virtual machines that use that network must be rebooted before the network becomes available or the changes are applied.
