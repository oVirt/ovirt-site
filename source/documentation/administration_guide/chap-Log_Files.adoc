=== SPICE Log Files

SPICE log files are useful when troubleshooting SPICE connection issues. To start SPICE debugging, change the log level to `debugging`. Then, identify the log location.

Both the clients used to access the guest machines and the guest machines themselves have SPICE log files. For client-side logs, if a SPICE client was launched using the native client, for which a *console.vv* file is downloaded, use the `remote-viewer` command to enable debugging and generate log output.
