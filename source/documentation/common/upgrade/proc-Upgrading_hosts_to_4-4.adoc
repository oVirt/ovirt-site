= Migrating hosts and virtual machines from {virt-product-shortname} 4.3 to 4.4

You can migrate hosts and virtual machines from {virt-product-fullname} 4.3 to 4.4 such that you minimize the downtime of virtual machines in your environment.

This process requires migrating all virtual machines from one host so as to make that host available to upgrade to {virt-product-shortname} 4.4. After the upgrade, you can reattach the host to the {engine-name}.

[NOTE]
====
CPU-passthrough virtual machines might not migrate properly from {virt-product-shortname} 4.3 to {virt-product-shortname} 4.4.

{virt-product-shortname} 4.3 and {virt-product-shortname} 4.4 are based on {enterprise-linux-shortname} 7 and {enterprise-linux-shortname} 8, respectively, which have different kernel versions with different CPU flags and microcodes. This can cause problems in migrating CPU-passthrough virtual machines.

.Prerequisites

* Hosts for {virt-product-shortname} 4.4 require {enterprise-linux} 8.2 or later. A clean installation of {enterprise-linux} 8.2 or later, or {hypervisor-fullname} 4.4 is required, even if you are using the same physical machine that you use to run hosts for {virt-product-shortname} 4.3.
* {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} 4.4 is installed and running.
* The compatibility level of the data center and cluster to which the hosts belong is set to 4.2 or 4.3.
All data centers and clusters in the environment must have the cluster compatibility level set to version 4.2 or 4.3 before you start the procedure.

.Procedure

. Pick a host to upgrade and migrate that host's virtual machines to another host in the same cluster. You can use Live Migration to minimize virtual machine downtime. For more information, see
link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#sect-Migrating_Virtual_Machines_Between_Hosts[Migrating Virtual Machines Between Hosts] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.

. Put the host into maintenance mode and remove the host from the {engine-name}. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#Removing_a_host[Removing a Host] in the _Administration Guide_.

. Install {enterprise-linux} 8.2 or later, or {hypervisor-shortname} 4.4. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_standalone_manager_with_local_databases/index#Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SM_localDB_deploy[Installing Hosts for {virt-product-fullname}] in one of the _Installing {virt-product-fullname}_ guides.

. Install the appropriate packages to enable the host for {virt-product-shortname} 4.4. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_standalone_manager_with_local_databases/index#Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SM_localDB_deploy[Installing Hosts for {virt-product-fullname}] in one of the _Installing {virt-product-fullname}_ guides.

. Add this host to the {engine-name}, assigning it to the same cluster. You can now migrate virtual machines onto this host. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_standalone_manager_with_local_databases/index#Adding_standard_hosts_to_the_Manager_SM_localDB_deploy[Adding Standard Hosts to the {engine-name}] in one of the _Installing {virt-product-fullname}_ guides.

Repeat these steps to migrate virtual machines and upgrade hosts for the rest of the hosts in the same cluster, one by one, until all are running {virt-product-fullname} 4.4.
