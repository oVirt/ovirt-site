## ALPHA DEVELOPMENT

In order to install this Alplha develoment you will need to [enable nightly snapshot repository](https://ovirt.org/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot.html).


## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.5.0 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.5.0 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.5.0).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.

### Release Note

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 2021545](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021545) **[RFE] Add cluster-level 4.7**

   In this release we have added DataCenter/Cluster compatibility level 4.7, which is available only on hosts with RHEL 8.6+, latest CentOS Stream 8 and CentOS Stream/RHEL 9 with libvirt &gt;= 8.0.0 installed.

 - [BZ 2015093](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015093) **[RFE] Implement hypervirors core dump related configuration to work on EL8 and EL9**

   oVirt 4.5 has moved from abrt to systemd-coredump to gather crash dumps on the hypervisors

 - [BZ 2010205](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2010205) **vm_kill_paused_time value should be determined from io_timeout**

   Vdsm configuration option vars.vm_kill_paused_time was removed. The corresponding value is directly dependent on the value of recently introduced sanlock.io_timeout option and needn't be configured separately.

 - [BZ 1940824](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1940824) **[RFE] Upgrade OVN/OVS 2.11 in RHV to OVN/OVS 2.15**

   Upgrade from OvS/OVN 2.11 to OVN 2021 and OvS 2.15.



The upgrade is transparent to user as long as few conditions are met:



1) The engine must be upgraded first.

2) Before any host upgrade the ovirt-provider-ovn security groups must be disabled for all OVN networks that are expected to work between host with OVN/OvS version 2.11.

3) Upgrade hosts to match the OVN version 2021 or higher and OvS version to 2.15. This step should be done via the UI, in order to reconfigure OVN and refresh certificates.





To check if provider and OVN was configured successfully on the host, webadmin includes OVN configured flag in General tab for every host, at the same time this value is available via REST API. 



Fixing the host's OVN not being confiugred can be done by reinstalling it from engine 4.5 or higher.


#### oVirt Engine

### Enhancements

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 2012830](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2012830) **[RFE] Use lvmdevices instead of lvm filter on RHEL 8.6/Centos Steam 9**

   Feature: Use LVM devices instead lvm filter to manage storage devices.



Reason: LVM filter is hard to manage and also in some case hard to set up in a correct way. LVM devices provides more easy way how to manage devices. Morover, starting CentOS Stream 9/RHEL 9, this will be the default used by LVM.



Result:

With this feature, vdsm use LVM devices file for managing storage devices and LVM filter is not needed any more.

 - [BZ 1975720](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1975720) **[RFE] Huge VMs require an additional migration parameter**

   Support for parallel migration connections was added.



See https://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/virt/parallel-migration-connections.html for all the important information about the feature.

 - [BZ 1944834](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944834) **[RFE] Timer for Console Disconnect Action - Shutdown VM after N minutes of being disconnected (Webadmin-only)**

   The feature adds a user-specified delay to the 'Shutdown' Console Disconnect Action of a VM. The shutdown won't be immediate anymore, but will occur after the delay, unless the user reconnects to the VM console, when it will be canceled.

This prevents a user's session loss after an accidental disconnect.

 - [BZ 1964208](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1964208) **[RFE] add new feature for VM's screenshot on RestAPI**

   Feature: Introduce capture VM screenshot API call



Add screenshot API that captures the current screen of a VM, and then returns PPM file screenshot



the user can then download the screenshot and view it content

 - [BZ 1616436](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1616436) **[RFE] Sparsify uploads**

   Feature: Detect zero areas in uploaded images and use optimized zero write method to write the zeroes to the underlying storage.



Reason: Not all clients support sparse files when uploading images, resulting in fully allocated images even when the disk is using thin allocation policy.



Result:

Images uploaded to disks with thin allocation policy remain sparse, minimizing the storage allocation. Uploading

images containing large zeroed areas is usually faster now.


#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 2029830](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2029830) **[RFE] Hosted engine should accept OpenSCAP profile name instead of bool**

   Hosted Engine installation now supports selecting either DISA STIG or PCI-DSS security profiles for the Hosted Engine VM


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 2003862](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2003862) **Missing default hv_stimer_direct, hv_ipi, hv_evmcs flags**

   hv_stimer_direct and hv_ipi Hyper-V flags are newly added to VMs when the cluster level is higher than 4.6.

 - [BZ 1944834](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944834) **[RFE] Timer for Console Disconnect Action - Shutdown VM after N minutes of being disconnected (Webadmin-only)**

   The feature adds a user-specified delay to the 'Shutdown' Console Disconnect Action of a VM. The shutdown won't be immediate anymore, but will occur after the delay, unless the user reconnects to the VM console, when it will be canceled.

This prevents a user's session loss after an accidental disconnect.

 - [BZ 1973251](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1973251) **[RFE] Making the number of virtio-scsi multi-queue configurable**

   Feature: Make the number of virtio-scsi multi-queue configurable



The virtio-scsi multi-queue scsi is currently boolean - either disabled or enabled, and when it's enabled the number of queues is determined automatically.



This RFE enables the user to specify the desired number of multi-queues

 - [BZ 1927985](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1927985) **[RFE] Speed up export-to-OVA on NFS by aligning loopback device offset**

   Padding between files is now added when exporting a VM to OVA. The goal is to align disks in the OVA to the edge of a block of the underlying filesystem. In this case disks are written faster during the export, especially to an NFS partition.

 - [BZ 1616436](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1616436) **[RFE] Sparsify uploads**

   Feature: Detect zero areas in uploaded images and use optimized zero write method to write the zeroes to the underlying storage.



Reason: Not all clients support sparse files when uploading images, resulting in fully allocated images even when the disk is using thin allocation policy.



Result:

Images uploaded to disks with thin allocation policy remain sparse, minimizing the storage allocation. Uploading
images containing large zeroed areas is usually faster now.

 - [BZ 1979797](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1979797) **Ask user for confirmation when the deleted storage domain has leases of VMs that has disk in other SDs**

   Adds a new warning message in the removing storage domain window in case that the selected domain has leases for entities that raised on a different storage domain.

 - [BZ 1838089](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1838089) **[RFE] Please allow placing domain in maintenance mode with suspended VM**

   Storage domain can now be deactivated and set to maintenance even if there are suspended VMs.



Note, a suspended VM will be able to run only when all the storage domains disks (including memory disks) are active.

 - [BZ 655153](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=655153) **[RFE] confirmation prompt when suspending a virtual machine - webadmin**

   Previously, no confirmation dialog was shown for the suspend VM operation. A virtual machine was suspending right after clicking the suspend-VM button.



Now, a confirmation dialog is presented by default when pressing the suspend-VM button. The user can choose not to show this confirmation dialog again. That setting can be reverted in the user preferences dialog.
