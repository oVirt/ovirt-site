# Chapter 2: Deploying Self-Hosted Engine

## Deploying Self-Hosted Engine on Enterprise Linux Hosts

### Installing the Self-Hosted Engine Packages

**Installing the Self-Hosted Engine**

1. Install the self-hosted engine packages:

        # yum install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup

2. Install the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance package for the Engine virtual machine installation:

        # yum install ovirt-engine-appliance

Proceed to the next section to deploy and configure self-hosted engine on an Enterprise Linux host.

### Configuring an EL-Based Self-Hosted Engine

The `hosted-engine` script is provided to assist with configuring the host, and the Engine virtual machine. The script asks you a series of questions, and configures your environment based on your answers.

Ensure that you have completed the following prerequisites:

**Prerequisites**

* You must have a freshly installed Enterprise Linux 7 system with the `ovirt-hosted-engine-setup` package installed.

* You must have prepared storage for your self-hosted engine environment. For more information on preparing storage for your deployment, see the "Storage" chapter of the [Administration Guide](/documentation/admin-guide/administration-guide/).

* You must have a fully qualified domain name prepared for your Engine and the host. Forward and reverse lookup records must both be set in the DNS.

* You must have prepared the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance for the Engine installation. Obtain the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance by installing the `ovirt-engine-appliance` package. Other methods of installing the Engine virtual machine operating system are not supported.

* To use the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance for the Engine installation, one directory must be at least 60 GB. The `hosted-engine` script first checks if `/var/tmp` has enough space to extract the appliance files. If not, you can specify a different directory or mount external storage. The VDSM user and KVM group must have read, write, and execute permissions on the directory.

**Configuring an EL-based Self-Hosted Engine**

1. **Initiating Hosted Engine Deployment**

    Run the `hosted-engine` script. To escape the script at any time, use the **CTRL** + **D** keyboard combination to abort deployment. It is recommended to use the `screen` window manager to run the script to avoid losing the session in case of network or terminal disruption. If not already installed, install the `screen` package, which is available in any typical Enterprise Linux repository.

        # yum install screen
        # screen
        # hosted-engine --deploy

    **Note:** In the event of session timeout or connection disruption, run `screen -d -r` to recover the `hosted-engine` deployment session.

2. **Configuring Storage**

    Select the type of storage to use.

        During customization use CTRL-D to abort.
        Please specify the storage you would like to use (glusterfs, iscsi, fc, nfs3, nfs4)[nfs3]:


    * For NFS storage types, specify the full address, using either the FQDN or IP address, and path name of the shared storage domain.

            Please specify the full shared storage connection path to use (example: host:/path): storage.example.com:/hosted_engine/nfs

    * For iSCSI, specify the iSCSI portal IP address, port, user name and password, and select a target name from the auto-detected list. You can only select one iSCSI target during the deployment.

            Please specify the iSCSI portal IP address:           
            Please specify the iSCSI portal port [3260]:           
            Please specify the iSCSI portal user:           
            Please specify the iSCSI portal password:
            Please specify the target name (auto-detected values) [default]:

    * For Gluster storage, specify the full address, using either the FQDN or IP address, and path name of the shared storage domain.

        **Important:** Only replica 3 Gluster storage is supported. Ensure the following configuration has been made:

        * In the `/etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol` file on all three Gluster servers, set `rpc-auth-allow-insecure` to `on`.

                option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on

        * Configure the volume as follows:

                gluster volume set volume cluster.quorum-type auto
                gluster volume set volume network.ping-timeout 10
                gluster volume set volume auth.allow \*
                gluster volume set volume group virt
                gluster volume set volume storage.owner-uid 36
                gluster volume set volume storage.owner-gid 36
                gluster volume set volume server.allow-insecure on

        <!-- comment ends list so line below is pre -->

            Please specify the full shared storage connection path to use (example: host:/path): storage.example.com:/hosted_engine/gluster_volume

    * For Fibre Channel, the host bus adapters must be configured and connected, and the `hosted-engine` script will auto-detect the LUNs available. The LUNs must not contain any existing data.

            The following luns have been found on the requested target:
            [1]     3514f0c5447600351       30GiB   XtremIO XtremApp
                                    status: used, paths: 2 active

            [2]     3514f0c5447600352       30GiB   XtremIO XtremApp
                                    status: used, paths: 2 active

            Please select the destination LUN (1, 2) [1]:

3. **Configuring the Network**

    The script detects possible network interface controllers (NICs) to use as a management bridge for the environment. It then checks your firewall configuration and offers to modify it for console (SPICE or VNC) access.

        Please indicate a nic to set oVirt Engine bridge on: (eth1, eth0) [eth1]:
        iptables was detected on your computer, do you wish setup to configure it? (Yes, No)[Yes]: Yes
        Please indicate a pingable gateway IP address [X.X.X.X]:

4. **Configuring the Virtual Machine**

    Select **disk** for the boot device type, and the script will automatically detect the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliances available. Specify the memory size.

                 Please specify the device to boot the VM from (choose disk for the oVirt engine appliance)
                 (cdrom, disk, pxe) [disk]:

        [ INFO ] Checking OVF archive content (could take a few minutes depending on archive size)</screen>

    Specify `Yes` if you want cloud-init to take care of the initial configuration of the Engine virtual machine. Specify **Generate** for cloud-init to take care of tasks like setting the root password, configuring networking, configuring the host name, injecting an answers file for `engine-setup` to use, and running `engine-setup` on boot. Optionally, select **Existing** if you have an existing cloud-init script to take care of more sophisticated functions of cloud-init. Specify the FQDN for the Engine virtual machine. Specify a MAC address for the HostedEngine-VM, or accept a randomly generated one. The MAC address can be used to update your DHCP and DNS server prior to installing the operating system on the virtual machine.

    **Note:** For more information on cloud-init, see [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

5. **Configuring the Hosted Engine**

    Specify a name for the host to be identified in the Administration Portal, and the password for the `admin@internal` user to access the Administration Portal. Provide the name and TCP port number of the SMTP server, the email address used to send email notifications, and a comma-separated list of email addresses to receive these notifications.

        Enter engine admin password: p@ssw0rd
        Confirm engine admin password: p@ssw0rd
        Enter the name which will be used to identify this host inside the Administrator Portal [hosted_engine_1]:
        Please provide the FQDN for the engine you would like to use.
                  This needs to match the FQDN that you will use for the engine installation within the VM.
                  Note: This will be the FQDN of the VM you are now going to create,
                  it should not point to the base host or to any other existing machine.

        Please provide a comma-separated list of email addresses which will get notifications [root@localhost]:</screen>

6. **Configuration Preview**

    Before proceeding, the `hosted-engine` script displays the configuration values you have entered, and prompts for confirmation to proceed with these values.

7. **Creating the Engine Virtual Machine**

    The script creates the Engine virtual machine, starts the `ovirt-engine` and high availability services, and connects the host and shared storage domain to the Engine virtual machine.

        You can now connect to the VM with the following command:
         /usr/bin/remote-viewer vnc://localhost:5900
        Use temporary password "3042QHpX" to connect to vnc console.
        Please note that in order to use remote-viewer you need to be able to run graphical applications.
        This means that if you are using ssh you have to supply the -Y flag (enables trusted X11 forwarding).
        Otherwise you can run the command from a terminal in your preferred desktop environment.
        If you cannot run graphical applications you can connect to the graphic console from another host or connect to the serial console using the following command:
        socat UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/ovirt-vmconsole-console/fabbea5a-1989-411f-8ed7-7abe0917fc66.sock,user=ovirt-vmconsole STDIO,raw,echo=0,escape=1
        If you need to reboot the VM you will need to start it manually using the command:
        hosted-engine --vm-start
        You can then set a temporary password using the command:
        hosted-engine --add-console-password
        [ INFO ] Running engine-setup on the appliance
        ...
        [ INFO ] Engine-setup successfully completed
        [ INFO ] Engine is still unreachable

        [ INFO  ] Stage: Pre-termination
        [ INFO  ] Stage: Termination</screen>

When the `hosted-engine` deployment script completes successfully, the oVirt Engine is configured and running on your host. The Engine has already configured the data center, cluster, host, the Engine virtual machine, and a shared storage domain dedicated to the Engine virtual machine.

**Important:** Log in as the **admin@internal** user to continue configuring the Engine and add further resources. You must create another data domain for the data center to be initialized to host regular virtual machine data, and for the Engine virtual machine to be visible. See "Storage" in the [Administration Guide](/documentation/admin-guide/administration-guide/) for different storage options and on how to add a data storage domain.

Link your oVirt Engine to a directory server so you can add additional users to the environment. oVirt supports many directory server types. Add a directory server to your environment using the `ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap-setup` interactive setup script. For more information, see "Configuring an External LDAP Provider" in the [Administration Guide](/documentation/admin-guide/administration-guide/).

The `ovirt-hosted-engine-setup` script also saves the answers you gave during configuration to a file, to help with disaster recovery. If a destination is not specified using the `--generate-answer=<file>` argument, the answer file is generated at `/etc/ovirt-hosted-engine/answers.conf`.

**Note:** SSH password authentication is not enabled by default on the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance. You can enable SSH password authentication by accessing the oVirt Engine virtual machine through the SPICE or VNC console. Verify that the `sshd` service is running. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and change the following two options to `yes`:

* `PasswordAuthentication`
* `PermitRootLogin`

**Note:** Restart the `sshd` service for the changes to take effect.

### Deploying Self-Hosted Engine on oVirt Node

On oVirt Node, self-hosted engine deployment is performed through the Cockpit user interface. A UI version of the `hosted-engine` script assists with configuring the host and Engine virtual machine. The script asks you a series of questions, and configures your environment based on your answers.  

**Prerequisites**

* You must have a freshly installed oVirt Node system. The **Performance Profile** in the **System** sub-tab of the Cockpit user interface must be set to `virtual-host`.

* You must have prepared storage for your self-hosted engine environment. For more information on preparing storage for your deployment, see the "Storage" chapter of the [Administration Guide](/documentation/admin-guide/administration-guide/).

* You must have a fully qualified domain name prepared for your Engine and the host. Forward and reverse lookup records must both be set in the DNS.

* To use the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance for the Engine installation, one directory must be at least 60 GB. The `hosted-engine` script first checks if `/var/tmp` has enough space to extract the appliance files. If not, you can specify a different directory or mount external storage. The VDSM user and KVM group must have read, write, and execute permissions on the directory.

**Configuring a oVirt Node-based Self-Hosted Engine**

1. **Obtaining the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance**

    Download the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance from the oVirt site:

    a. Visit [http://www.ovirt.org/node/](http://www.ovirt.org/node/).

    b. Click the Installation ISO link for the correct oVirt version.

2. **Initiating Self-Hosted Engine Deployment**

    Log in to the Cockpit user interface at `https://HostIPorFQDN:9090` and navigate to **Virtualization** > **Hosted Engine**. Click **Start**.

    ![](/images/self-hosted/SHEonRHVHstart.png)

    The text fields in the deployment script are pre-populated with a default answer if one is available; change or enter your answers as necessary.

    ![](/images/self-hosted/SHEonRHVHdeploy.png)

    **Note:** In this procedure, the deployment questions are presented in text form. In the UI, click **Next** when prompted.

        During customization use CTRL-D to abort.
        Continuing will configure this host for serving as hypervisor and create a VM where you have to install the engine afterwards.
        Are you sure you want to continue? (Yes, No)[Yes]:

3. **Configuring Storage**

    Select the type of storage to use.

        Please specify the storage you would like to use (glusterfs, iscsi, fc, nfs3, nfs4)[nfs3]:

    * For NFS storage types, specify the full address, using either the FQDN or IP address, and path name of the shared storage domain.

            Please specify the full shared storage connection path to use (example: host:/path): storage.example.com:/hosted_engine/nfs

    * For iSCSI, specify the iSCSI portal IP address, port, user name and password, and select a target name from the auto-detected list. You can only select one iSCSI target during the deployment.

            Please specify the iSCSI portal IP address:
            Please specify the iSCSI portal port [3260]:
            Please specify the iSCSI portal user:
            Please specify the iSCSI portal password:
            Please specify the target name (auto-detected values) [default]:

    * For Gluster storage, specify the full address, using either the FQDN or IP address, and path name of the shared storage domain.

        **Important:** Only replica 3 Gluster storage is supported. Ensure the following configuration has been made:

        * In the `/etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol` file on all three Gluster servers, set `rpc-auth-allow-insecure` to `on`.

                option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on

        * Configure the volume as follows:

                gluster volume set volume cluster.quorum-type auto
                gluster volume set volume network.ping-timeout 10
                gluster volume set volume auth.allow \*
                gluster volume set volume group virt
                gluster volume set volume storage.owner-uid 36

7. **Configuration Preview**

    Before proceeding, the `hosted-engine` script displays the configuration values you have entered, and prompts for confirmation to proceed with these values.

        Please confirm installation settings (Yes, No)[Yes]: Yes

The script creates the Engine virtual machine, starts the `ovirt-engine` and high availability services, and connects the host and shared storage domain to the Engine virtual machine.

When the `hosted-engine` deployment script completes successfully, the oVirt Engine is configured and running on your host. The Engine has already configured the data center, cluster, host, the Engine virtual machine, and a shared storage domain dedicated to the Engine virtual machine.

**Important:** Log in to the Administration Portal as the **admin@internal** user to continue configuring the Engine and add further resources. You must create another data domain for the data center to be initialized to host regular virtual machine data, and for the Engine virtual machine to be visible. See "Storage" in the [Administration Guide](/documentation/admin-guide/administration-guide/) for different storage options and on how to add a data storage domain.

Link your oVirt Engine to a directory server so you can add additional users to the environment. oVirt supports many directory server types. Add a directory server to your environment using the `ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap-setup` interactive setup script. For more information, see "Configuring an External LDAP Provider" in the [Administration Guide](/documentation/admin-guide/administration-guide/).

The script also saves the answers you gave during configuration to a file, to help with disaster recovery. If a destination is not specified using the `--generate-answer=<file>` argument, the answer file is generated at `/etc/ovirt-hosted-engine/answers.conf`.

**Note:** SSH password authentication is not enabled by default on the oVirt Engine Virtual Appliance. You can enable SSH password authentication by accessing the oVirt Engine virtual machine through the SPICE or VNC console. Verify that the `sshd` service is running. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and change the following two options to `yes`:

* `PasswordAuthentication`
* `PermitRootLogin`

Restart the `sshd` service for the changes to take effect.

### Administering the Engine Virtual Machine

The `hosted-engine` utility is provided to assist with administering the Manager virtual machine. It can be run on any self-hosted engine hosts in the environment. For all the options, run `hosted-engine --help`. For additional information on a specific command, run `hosted-engine --command --help`.
