title: Using oVirt Engine with a PostgreSQL container.
authors: jbrooks, leni1
---

The base environment used here is CentOS 7.

1. Install ovirt-engine:

```
yum install -y http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm
yum install ovirt-engine -y
```

2. Start postgres container:

```
docker run --name=postgresql -d -p 5432:5432 registry.centos.org/centos/postgres:latest 
```

3. Prepare the PostgreSQL database according to the guide below:
https://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/appe-Preparing_a_Remote_PostgreSQL_Database_for_Use_with_the_oVirt_Engine/


```
docker exec -ti postgresql bash
su - postgres
psql

postgres=# create role engine with login encrypted password 'password';
postgres=# create database engine owner engine template template0 encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8' lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';
postgres=# \q

vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
```

Ensure the database can be accessed remotely by enabling md5 client authentication. Edit the /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf file, and add the following line immediately underneath the line starting with local at the bottom of the file, replacing X.X.X.X with the IP address of the Engine:

```
 host    database_name    user_name    X.X.X.X/32   md5
```

Edit `postgresql.conf` and add following lines:

```
vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01
autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.075
autovacuum_max_workers = 6
maintenance_work_mem = 65536
max_connections = 150
lc_messages = 'en_US.UTF-8'
```

4. Restart the database within the container:

```
-bash-4.2$ pg_ctl restart
exit
exit
```

5. Setup ovirt-engine:

```
engine-setup

          Data Warehouse was not set up. Please set it up on some other machine and configure access to it on the engine.

You should be able to access oVirt's web portal at the address mentioned above. 

Notes: When you first start your machine, be sure to start the Docker container that has your database. 
After this, restart the `ovirt-engine` service using the following command:
  `systemctl restart ovirt-engine`

Do use the image pulled from registry.centos.org/centos/postgres:latest. 
The one provided by PostgreSQL is difficult to configure since it seems intended to use as is. Your mileage on this may vary. 
The 404 error that appears initially should disappear and you should get the web login page for oVirt, after a few seconds or so.
