= Getting information about the disks in a backup

[role="_abstract"]
You can get information about the disks that are part of the backup, including the backup mode that was used for each disk in a backup, which helps determine the mode that you use to download the backup.

The `list` method of the VmBackupDisks service returns the following information about a backup:

    * The id and name of each disk that was backed up.
    * The id of the disk image of the backup, for each disk included in the backup.
    * The disk format.
    * The backup behavior supported by the disk.
    * The backup type that was taken for the disk (full/incremental).

.Procedure

* To get information about a backup with id 456 of a virtual machine with id 123, send a request like this:
