// Retains the context of the parent assembly if this assembly is nested within another assembly.

ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id="my-assembly-a"]
// * Title: = My assembly A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="a-collection-of-modules"]
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id="a-collection-of-modules-{context}"].
= A collection of modules
//If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.
:context: assembly-keyword
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

This paragraph is the assembly introduction. It explains what the user will accomplish by working through the modules in the assembly and sets the context for the user story the assembly is based on. Can include more than one paragraph. Consider using the information from the user story.

.Prerequisites

* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this assembly.
* You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this assembly.
* Delete the section title and bullets if the assembly has no prerequisites.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other assemblies.

include::modules/TEMPLATE_CONCEPT_explaining_a_concept.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// [leveloffset=+1] ensures that when a module starts with a level-1 heading (= Heading), the heading will be interpreted as a level-2 heading (== Heading) in the assembly.

include::modules/TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_doing_one_procedure.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Additional resources (or Next steps)

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the assembly, including xref links to other assemblies in your collection.
