## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL


## RELEASE CANDIDATE

In order to install this Release Candidate you will need to enable pre-release repository.




In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43-pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43-pre.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).



### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)

### EPEL

Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.
