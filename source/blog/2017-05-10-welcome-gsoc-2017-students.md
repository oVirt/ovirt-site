![](/images/ovirt-gsoc-logo.png) The oVirt project is glad to announce that five talented students will be joining the oVirt community over the summer period, as part of the 2017 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Outreachy internship programs.

Both GSoC and Outreachy focus on getting more student developers interested in open source software development, as well as providing opportunities for talented people, underrepresented in the tech world, to gain valuable technology experience. The students will spend their summer break writing code, learning about open source development and documentation, and earning a stipend.
