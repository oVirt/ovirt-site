==== Syntax for the oVirt Engine Rename Command

The basic syntax for the `ovirt-engine-rename` command is:

[source,terminal]
----
# /usr/share/ovirt-engine/setup/bin/ovirt-engine-rename
----
The command also accepts the following options:

*`--newname=_[new name]_`*:: Allows you to specify the new fully qualified domain name for the {engine-name} without user interaction.


*`--log=_[file]_`*:: Allows you to specify the path and name of a file into which logs of the rename operation are to be written.


*`--config=_[file]_`*:: Allows you to specify the path and file name of a configuration file to load into the rename operation.


*`--config-append=_[file]_`*:: Allows you to specify the path and file name of a configuration file to append to the rename operation. This option can be used to specify the path and file name of an existing answer file to automate the rename operation.


*`--generate-answer=_[file]_`*:: Allows you to specify the path and file name of the file in which your answers and the values changed by the `ovirt-engine-rename` command are recorded.
