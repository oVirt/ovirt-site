|*Template* |The template and template sub-version on which the virtual machine pool is based. If you create a pool based on the `latest` sub-version of a template, all virtual machines in the pool, when rebooted, will automatically receive the latest template version. For more information on configuring templates for virtual machines see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}vmm-guide/Virtual_Machine_Management_Guide.html#Virtual_Machine_General_settings_explained[Virtual Machine General Settings Explained] and link:{URL_virt_product_docs}vmm-guide/Virtual_Machine_Management_Guide.html#Explanation_of_Settings_in_the_New_Template_and_Edit_Template_Windows[Explanation of Settings in the New Template and Edit Template Windows] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.
