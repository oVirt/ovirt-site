+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhvh-4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
----

* For {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms \
    --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms \
    --enable=rhv-4-mgmt-agent-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms \

endif::[]
ifdef::ovirt-doc[]
* For {hypervisor-fullname}s, the `ovirt-release44` RPM package enabling the correct repositories is already installed. Ensure it is updated to the latest version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf update -y ovirt-release44
----

* For {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s:
+
[source,terminal]

. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts] and select the host to be updated.

. Click menu:Installation[Check for Upgrade] and click btn:[OK].
+
Open the *Notification Drawer* (image:common/images/EventsIcon.png[]) and expand the *Events* section to see the result.

. If an update is available, click menu:Installation[Upgrade].

. Click btn:[OK] to update the host. Running virtual machines are migrated according to their migration policy. If migration is disabled for any virtual machines, you are prompted to shut them down.
+
The details of the host are updated in menu:Compute[Hosts] and the status transitions through these stages:
+
*Maintenance > Installing > Reboot > Up*
+
[NOTE]
====
If the update fails, the host's status changes to *Install Failed*. From *Install Failed* you can click menu:Installation[Upgrade] again.
====

Repeat this procedure for each host in the {virt-product-fullname} environment.
