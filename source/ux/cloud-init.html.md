# cloud init

## Alternate concepts for representation of deep hierarchies of information

There is interest to embed the cloud init feature into the Create and Edit VM dialog and this poses an interesting display issue as it increases the amount of hierarchical levels of information to be presented. Here are a few alternate concepts for how this could be presented. Your feedback on these are welcome.

**Concept 1 - Separate dialog**

Although we try to avoid dialog upon dialog overlay, this may be ok here since the cloud init is a sizeable set of fields that needs to be configured as a supplementary task during the creation or editing of the VM. In the mockup below, the user would see the general fields for Initial Run but a button for Cloud init config and upon clicking of that button, the Cloud init dialog will show up with all relevant fields there. The user would make changes , press ok or cancel and then resume VM configuration here.
