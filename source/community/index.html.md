# Community

oVirt is a community project, and we welcome contributions from everyone! If you'd like to write code, report bugs, contribute designs, or enhance the documentation, we would love your help!

There are a few ways to engage with the oVirt Community:

* [Forums / Mailing lists](https://lists.ovirt.org/archives/)
* [oVirt Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ovirt.openvirtualization/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ovirt)
* IRC -- `#ovirt` on `irc.oftc.net`

Before getting started, please read our [community etiquette guidelines](/community/about/community-guidelines.html).

## Developers

If you'd like to contribute code to oVirt, visit the [Developer section](/develop/) of the site for guidelines. All of our projects use git. Most are hosted at [https://gerrit.ovirt.org/](https://gerrit.ovirt.org/), and the rest are hosted at [https://github.com/oVirt](https://github.com/oVirt/).

## Translate

oVirt's user interface and documentation are available in multiple languages for users around the globe. Examples include Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and more. To contribute translations, sign up for [Zanata](https://translate.zanata.org) and access our [project](https://translate.zanata.org/project/view/ovirt).

## Documentation

oVirt needs concise, user-friendly, up-to-date installation and usage documentation. To contribute, visit the [documentation repository](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/tree/master/source/documentation) and the [documentation issues tracker](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation). You can also report any documentation issues you find by clicking "Report an issue with this page" at the bottom of the documentation.

## Report Bugs and New Feature Requests (RFEs)

Reporting bugs is one of the most valuable ways you can contribute! Ideas for new features are also very welcome. Report bugs and RFEs using the following issue trackers:

* [Bugzilla - bugs and RFEs in oVirt Engine and oVirt Node](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt)
* [VM Portal GitHub - bugs and RFEs in VM Portal](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-web-ui/issues)
* [oVirt Documentation GitHub - Documentation issues](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation)
* Security issues follow a [special reporting procedure](/develop/security/security.html).

## Participate in the oVirt infrastructure

Our project infrastructure can always benefit from extra people, hardware and network bandwidth. First of all, consider [becoming a public mirror](/develop/infra/repository-mirrors.html) of oVirt repositories. You can also [become an infra team member](/develop/infra/becoming-an-infrastructure-team-member.html) or [donate hardware](/community/get-involved/donate-hardware.html) to the project to improve our capacity and redundancy.

## Supporters, Sponsors, and Providers

oVirt has a broad community of [supporters, sponsors, and providers](/community/user-stories/users-and-providers.html).
