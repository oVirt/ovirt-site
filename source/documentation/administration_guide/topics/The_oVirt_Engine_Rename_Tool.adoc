==== The oVirt Engine Rename Tool

When the `engine-setup` command is run in a clean environment, the command generates a number of certificates and keys that use the fully qualified domain name of the {engine-name} supplied during the setup process. If the fully qualified domain name of the {engine-name} must be changed later on (for example, due to migration of the machine hosting the {engine-name} to a different domain), the records of the fully qualified domain name must be updated to reflect the new name. The `ovirt-engine-rename` command automates this task.

The `ovirt-engine-rename` command updates records of the fully qualified domain name of the {engine-name} in the following locations:


* /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/10-setup-protocols.conf

* /etc/ovirt-engine/isouploader.conf.d/10-engine-setup.conf

* /etc/ovirt-engine/logcollector.conf.d/10-engine-setup.conf

* /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/cert.conf

* /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/cert.template

* /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/certs/apache.cer

* /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/apache.key.nopass

* /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/apache.p12


[WARNING]
====
While the `ovirt-engine-rename` command creates a new certificate for the web server on which the {engine-name} runs, it does not affect the certificate for the {engine-name} or the certificate authority. Due to this, there is some risk involved in using the `ovirt-engine-rename` command, particularly in environments that have been upgraded from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.2 and earlier. Therefore, changing the fully qualified domain name of the {engine-name} by running `engine-cleanup` and `engine-setup` is recommended where possible.

[WARNING]
====
During the upgrade process, the old hostname must be resolvable. If the oVirt Engine Rename Tool fails with the message `[ ERROR ] Host name is not valid: <OLD FQDN> did not resolve into an IP address`, add the old hostname to the `/etc/hosts` file, use the oVirt Engine Rename Tool, and then remove the old hostname from the `/etc/hosts` file.
