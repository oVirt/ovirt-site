= Contributing to oVirt documentation

== Different ways to contribute

There are a few different ways you can contribute to oVirt documentation:

// * Submit comments at the bottom of each topic (still awaiting implementation)
// * Email the oVirt documentation team rhev-docs@redhat.com
* https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/issues/new[Create an issue in GitHub]
* Submit a PR. You can clone the repository, make your changes, and submit a PR.
This option is best if you have substantial changes. If you open a PR, be sure
that all of its contents are related and apply to the same versions.

.What happens when you submit a PR?

The
// https://github.com/orgs/openshift/teams/team-documentation[documentation team]
documentation team
reviews the PR and arranges further review by the development and quality
assurance teams, as required.
If the PR requires changes, updates, or corrections, we will let you know
in the PR. We might request that you make the changes, or let you know that we
incorporated your content in a different PR. When the PR has been reviewed, all
updates are complete, and all commits are squashed, we'll merge the PR and it will
be published to the oVirt website.

== Repository organization
The oVirt documentation repository is stored under `/source/documentation`. Each directory corresponds to a guide, except `common`, which includes files that are shared between multiple guides. Each guide's directory includes `index.adoc` and `master.adoc` files. These are the top-level assemblies for that guide, where `index.adoc` is for oVirt and `master.adoc` is for Red Hat Virtualization, a downstream distribution of oVirt. Many guides include additional nested assemblies and a `topics` subdirectory with individual topics.

== Version management
Most of the content applies to oVirt and Red Hat Virtualization. While a large
amount of content is reused for both products, some information
applies to only one or the other. Content inclusion and exclusion is managed
by using a combination of `include` statements, `ifdef/endif` statements, and attributes
in individual files.
// by specifying distributions in the
//`&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` file or by using `ifdef/endif` statements in individual files.

////
While it is _possible_
to accomplish this solely with Git branches to maintain slightly different
versions of a given topic, doing so would make the task of maintaining internal
consistency extremely difficult for content contributors.

////

=== Conditional text between products
oVirt documentation uses AsciiDoc's `ifdef/endif` and `ifeval/endif` macros to conditionalize
and reuse content, down to the single-line level.

The supported distribution attributes used with the oVirt build mechanism
are:

* _ovirt-doc_
* _rhv-doc_

Here is an example of this concept in use:

----
This line is not conditionalized, and will appear for both oVirt and RHV.

\ifdef::ovirt-doc[]
This line will only appear for oVirt.
\endif::[]

ifdef::rhv-doc
This line will only appear for Red Hat Virtualization.
\endif::[]

----

[NOTE]
====
While the `ifdef/endif` blocks have no size limit, do not use them to
to conditionalize the text of an entire file within that file. Instead, use `include` statements to include the file in the top-level assembly, that is, the `index.adoc` file, or use `ifdef` macros around the `include` statement if the assembly is shared between oVirt and RHV.
====

== Release branches

////
With the combination of conditionalizing content within files with
`ifdef/endif` and conditionalizing whole files in the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml`
file, the `main` branch of
this repository always contains a complete set of documentation for all
OpenShift products. However, when and as new versions of an OpenShift product
are released, the `main` branch is merged down to new or existing release
branches. Here is the general naming scheme used in the branches:

* `main` - This is our *working* branch.
* `enterprise-N.N` - OpenShift Container Platform support releases. The docs
for OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated are based on the appropriate
`enterprise-N.N` branch.

On a 12-hourly basis, the documentation web sites are rebuilt for each of these
branches. This way the published content for each released version of an
OpenShift product remains the same while development continues on the
`main` branch. Additionally, any corrections or additions that are
"cherry-picked" into the release branches will show up in the published
documentation after 12 hours.
////

All published oVirt content is on the `master` branch.
Therefore, when submitting your work create the PR against the `master`
branch. After it is reviewed, a writer will merge the content.
