# Making an oVirt release

For the moment, this is just a link dump - there is lots of information about releases which hasn't been organoised as far as I can tell.

This page should ideally have a checklist of things we need to do before a release, including:

*   Release notes
*   Release announcement
*   Communication [press plan](/develop/release-management/process/press-plan.html)
*   Release talking points which can be used as the basis for review articles
*   Collected links related to the release

The [Subversion release procedure](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/branches/scons-build-system/www/release-process.html) covers a lot of the points of best practice in the area of doing a release.

## Generic materials

*   [Release Process](/develop/release-management/process/release-process.html) - could have more points related to the actual pushing out of the release and publicising it
