==== Power Management by Proxy in {virt-product-fullname}

The {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} does not communicate directly with fence agents. Instead, the {engine-name} uses a proxy to send power management commands to a host power management device. The {engine-name} uses VDSM to execute power management device actions, so another host in the environment is used as a fencing proxy.

You can select between:


* Any host in the same cluster as the host requiring fencing.

* Any host in the same data center as the host requiring fencing.

A viable fencing proxy host has a status of either *UP* or *Maintenance*.
