# Appendix E: Using Search, Bookmarks, and Tags

## Searches

### Performing Searches in oVirt

The Administration Portal enables the management of thousands of resources, such as virtual machines, hosts, users, and more. To perform a search, enter the search query (free-text or syntax-based) into the search bar. Search queries can be saved as bookmarks for future reuse, so you do not have to reenter a search query each time the specific search results are required. Searches are not case sensitive.

### Search Syntax and Examples

The syntax of the search queries for oVirt resources is as follows:

`result type: {criteria} [sortby sort_spec]`

**Syntax Examples**

The following examples describe how the search query is used and help you to understand how oVirt assists with building search queries.

**Example Search Queries**

| Example | Result |
|-
| Hosts: Vms.status = up | Displays a list of all hosts running virtual machines that are up. |
| Vms: domain = qa.company.com | Displays a list of all virtual machines running on the specified domain. |
| Vms: users.name = Mary | Displays a list of all virtual machines belonging to users with the user name Mary. |
| Events: severity &gt; normal sortby time | Displays the list of all Events whose severity is higher than Normal, sorted by time. |

### Search Auto-Completion

The Administration Portal provides auto-completion to help you create valid and powerful search queries. As you type each part of a search query, a drop-down list of choices for the next part of the search opens below the Search Bar. You can either select from the list and then continue typing/selecting the next part of the search, or ignore the options and continue entering your query manually.

The following table specifies by example how the Administration Portal auto-completion assists in constructing a query:

` Hosts: Vms.status = down `

**Example Search Queries Using Auto-Completion**

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>Input</td>
   <td>List Items Displayed</td>
   <td>Action</td>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><tt> h </tt></td>
   <td><tt>Hosts</tt> (1 option only)</td>
   <td>
    <p>Select <tt>Hosts</tt> or;</p>
    <p>Type <tt> Hosts </tt></p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><tt> Hosts: </tt></td>
   <td>All host properties</td>
   <td>Type <tt> v </tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><tt> Hosts: v </tt></td>
   <td>host properties starting with a <tt>v</tt></td>
   <td>Select <tt>Vms</tt> or type <tt> Vms </tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><tt> Hosts: Vms </tt></td>
   <td>All virtual machine properties</td>
   <td>Type <tt> s </tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><tt> Hosts: Vms.s </tt></td>
   <td>All virtual machine properties beginning with <tt>s</tt></td>
   <td>Select <tt>status</tt> or type <tt> status </tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><tt> Hosts: Vms.status = </tt></td>
   <td>All status values</td>
   <td>Select or type <tt> down </tt></td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

### Search Result Type Options

The result type allows you to search for resources of any of the following types:

* **Vms** for a list of virtual machines

* **Host** for a list of hosts

* **Pools** for a list of pools

* **Template** for a list of templates

* **Event** for a list of events

* **Users** for a list of users

* **Cluster** for a list of clusters

* **Datacenter** for a list of data centers

* **Storage** for a list of storage domains

As each type of resource has a unique set of properties and a set of other resource types that it is associated with, each search type has a set of valid syntax combinations. You can also use the auto-complete feature to create valid queries easily.

### Search Criteria

You can specify the search criteria after the colon in the query. The syntax of `{criteria}` is as follows:

    <prop><operator><value>

or

    <obj-type><prop><operator><value>

**Examples**

The following table describes the parts of the syntax:

**Example Search Criteria**

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>Part</td>
   <td>Description</td>
   <td>Values</td>
   <td>Example</td>
   <td>Note</td>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>prop</td>
   <td>The property of the searched-for resource. Can also be the property of a resource type (see <tt>obj-type</tt>), or <i>tag</i> (custom tag).</td>
   <td>Limit your search to objects with a certain property. For example, search for objects with a <i>status</i> property.</td>
   <td>Status</td>
   <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

     <li>Wildcards can be used within strings.</li>
     <li>"" (two sets of quotation marks with no space between them) can be used to represent an un-initialized (empty) string.</li>
     <li>Double quotes should be used around a string or date containing spaces</li>
    </ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

### Search: Multiple Criteria and Wildcards

Wildcards can be used in the `<value>` part of the syntax for strings. For example, to find all users beginning with **m**, enter `m*`.

You can perform a search having two criteria by using the Boolean operators `AND` and `OR`. For example:

` Vms: users.name = m* AND status = Up `

This query returns all running virtual machines for users whose names begin with "m".

` Vms: users.name = m* AND tag = "paris-loc" `

This query returns all virtual machines tagged with "paris-loc" for users whose names begin with "m".

When two criteria are specified without `AND` or `OR`, `AND` is implied. `AND` precedes `OR`, and `OR` precedes implied `AND`.

### Search: Determining Search Order

You can determine the sort order of the returned information by using `sortby`. Sort direction (`asc` for ascending, `desc` for descending) can be included.

For example:

` events: severity > normal sortby time desc `

This query returns all Events whose severity is higher than Normal, sorted by time (descending order).

## Tags

### Using Tags to Customize Interactions with oVirt

After your oVirt platform is set up and configured to your requirements, you can customize the way you work with it using tags. Tags provide one key advantage to system administrators: they allow system resources to be arranged into groups or categories. This is useful when many objects exist in the virtualization environment and the administrator would like to concentrate on a specific set of them.

This section describes how to create and edit tags, assign them to hosts or virtual machines and search using the tags as criteria. Tags can be arranged in a hierarchy that matches a structure, to fit the needs of the enterprise.

Administration Portal Tags can be created, modified, and removed using the **Tags** pane.

### Creating a Tag

Create tags so you can filter search results using tags.

**Creating a Tag**

1. Click the **Tags** tab on the left side of the screen.

2. Select the node under which you wish to create the tag. For example, to create it at the highest level, click the **root** node.

3. Click the **New** button to open the **New Tag** window.

4. Enter the **Name** and **Description** of the new tag.

5. Click **OK** to create the tag.

The new tag is created and displays on the **Tags** tab.

### Modifying a Tag
