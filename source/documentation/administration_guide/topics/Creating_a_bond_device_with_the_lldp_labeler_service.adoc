= Creating a Bond Device with the LLDP Labeler Service

The LLDP Labeler service enables you to create a bond device automatically with all unbonded NICs, for all the hosts in one or more clusters or in the entire data center. The bonding mode is xref:Bonding_Modes[`(Mode 4) Dynamic Link Aggregation(802.3ad)`].

NICs with xref:Bond_logical_networks_compatibility[incompatible logical networks] cannot be bonded.

include::../common/network/proc-Configuring_LLDP_Labeler.adoc[]

. Attach a logical network to the new bond and configure it. See xref:Editing_Host_Network_Interfaces_and_Assigning_Logical_Networks_to_Hosts[] for instructions.

[NOTE]

You cannot attach a logical network directly to an individual NIC in the bond.
