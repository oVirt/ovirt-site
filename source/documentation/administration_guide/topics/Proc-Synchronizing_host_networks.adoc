= Synchronizing Host Networks

The {engine-name} defines a network interface as `out-of-sync` when the definition of the interface on the host differs from the definitions stored by the {engine-name}.

Out-of-sync networks appear with an Out-of-sync icon image:images/out-of-sync.png[Title="Out-of-sync icon"] in the host's *Network Interfaces* tab and with this icon image:images/out-of-sync-setup.png[Title="Out-of-sync setup icon"] in the *Setup Host Networks* window.

When a host's network is out of sync, the only activities that you can perform on the unsynchronized network in the *Setup Host Networks* window are detaching the logical network from the network interface or synchronizing the network.

.Understanding How a Host Becomes out-of-sync
A host will become out of sync if:

* You make configuration changes on the host rather than using the the *Edit Logical Networks* window, for example:
** Changing the VLAN identifier on the physical host.

** Changing the *Custom MTU* on the physical host.

* You move a host to a different data center with the same network name, but with different values/parameters.

* You change a network's *VM Network* property by manually removing the bridge from the host.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you change the network’s *MTU* settings, you must propagate this change to the running virtual machines on the network: Hot unplug and replug every virtual machine’s vNIC that should apply the MTU setting, or restart the virtual machines. Otherwise, these interfaces fail when the virtual machine migrates to another host.

.Preventing Hosts from Becoming Unsynchronized
Following these best practices will prevent your host from becoming unsynchronized:

. Use the Administration Portal to make changes rather than making changes locally on the host.

. Edit VLAN settings according to the instructions in xref:Editing-VLAN-Settings[Editing VLAN Settings].

.Synchronizing Hosts
Synchronizing a host's network interface definitions involves using the definitions from the {engine-name} and applying them to the host. If these are not the definitions that you require, after synchronizing your hosts update their definitions from the Administration Portal.
You can synchronize a host's networks on three levels:

* Per logical network
* Per host
* Per cluster

.Synchronizing Host Networks on the Logical Network Level

. Click menu:Compute[Hosts].
. Click the host's name. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Network Interfaces* tab.
. Click *Setup Host Networks*.
. Hover your cursor over the unsynchronized network and click the pencil icon. This opens the *Edit Network* window.
. Select the *Sync network* check box.
. Click btn:[OK] to save the network change.
. Click btn:[OK] to close the *Setup Host Networks* window.

.Synchronizing a Host's Networks on the Host level

* Click the *Sync All Networks* button in the host's *Network Interfaces* tab to synchronize all of the host's unsynchronized network interfaces.

.Synchronizing a Host's Networks on the Cluster level
* Click the *Sync All Networks* button in the cluster's *Logical Networks* tab to synchronize all unsynchronized logical network definitions for the entire cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can also synchronize a host's networks via the REST API. See link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}rest_api_guide/index#services-host-methods-sync_all_networks[syncallnetworks] in the _REST API Guide_.
