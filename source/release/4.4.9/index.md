## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.9 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.9 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.9).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.9?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 2007550](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007550) **Change type of disk write/read rate from integer to long**

   Change the type of the virtual machines disk write/read rate from integer to long.

 - [BZ 1992690](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992690) **[RFE] Customize 'oVirt Inventory Dashboard' to include cluster wide information about 'CPUs Overcommit' and 'Running VMs - CPU Cores vs. Total Hosts-CPU Cores'**

   The Inventory dashboard showed until now overcommits rates for each data center, now overcommits rates for each cluster is available too.


#### VDSM

 - [BZ 2004469](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004469) **[RHV 4.4.8] Unable to upgrade RHVH if vdsm-hook-ethtool-options is installed**

   When custom VDSM hooks are installed on RHVH, it was not possible to upgrade RHVH to 4.4.8. We have need to remove VDSM hooks dependency on the concrete version of VDSM, so customers now need to maintain that dependency by themselves (meaning if customers upgrade VDSM from X.Y.Z to version A.B.C, they need also upgrade all VDSM hooks to the same version A.B.C


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 2004444](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004444) **Try to enable cinderlib repos on host during host upgrade**

   During host installation or host upgrade engine is checking if cinderlib and ceph packages are available and if not, it tries to enable required channels specified in the documentation. If there is a problem during channel enablement, then error is raised into audit_log and customers need to enable channel manually and afterwards retry installation/upgrade


#### ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap

 - [BZ 2010658](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2010658) **AAA LDAP extension is querying DNS with ANY request**

   ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap has been using single request to fetch both A and AAAA records from DNS servers in mixed IPv4/IPv6 setups. Underlying JVM transformed this request to ANY DNS call, which has been recently deprecated by RFC 8482 and that why we haven't got valid addresses from some DNS servers.

From version 1.4.5 ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap is going to fetch A and AAAA records in separate DNS requests.


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1999563](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999563) **[RFE] Add a unique number to each panel in Grafana**

   Feature: 

There are panels that have the same panel number, and panels with no panel number at all. 



Reason: 

The goal is to help the user and us identify and differentiate between panels and dashboards in a much easier way.



Result:

We would like to delete all the existing numbers, and add a unique number to each panel in Grafana.


#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1984886](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1984886) **Include rsyslog-openssl package on hosts**

   Feature: rsyslog-openssl package is now installed by default on the hosts and included in oVirt Node (community) and RHV-H (product)



Reason: rsyslog-openssl allow to setup remote logging using an encrypted channel.



Result: No need to manually install a package to setup remote encrypted logging.
