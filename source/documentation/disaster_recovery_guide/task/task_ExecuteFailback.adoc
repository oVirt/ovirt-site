=== Execute a Failback

Once you fail over, you can fail back to the primary site when it is active and you have performed the necessary steps to clean the environment.

*Prerequisites*:

* The environment in the primary site is running and has been cleaned, see <<clean>> for more information.
* The environment in the secondary site is running, and has active storage domains.
* A machine running Red Hat Ansible Engine that can connect via SSH to the {engine-name} in the primary and secondary site, with the required packages and files:
** The `oVirt.disaster-recovery` package.
** The mapping file and required failback playbook.

This example uses the `dr-rhv-failback.yml` playbook created earlier.

*Executing a failback*:

. Run the failback playbook with the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
#  ansible-playbook dr-rhv-failback.yml --tags "fail_back"
----

. Enable replication from the primary storage domains to the secondary storage domains.
