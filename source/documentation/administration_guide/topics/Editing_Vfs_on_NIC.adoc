==== Configuring virtual functions on a NIC

include::../../common/sriov/conc-Set_Up_and_Configure_SR-IOV.adoc[]

Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) enables you to use each PCIe endpoint as multiple separate devices by using physical functions (PFs) and virtual functions (VFs). A PCIe card can have between one and eight PFs. Each PF can have many VFs. The number of VFs it can have depends on the specific type of PCIe device.

To configure SR-IOV-capable Network Interface Controllers (NICs), you use the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}.  There, you can configure the number of VFs on each NIC.


You can configure a VF like you would configure a standalone NIC, including:

* Assigning one or more logical networks to the VF.
* Creating bonded interfaces with VFs.
* Assigning vNICs to VFs for direct device passthrough.

By default, all virtual networks have access to the virtual functions. You can disable this default and specify which networks have access to a virtual function.

.Prerequisite

* For a vNIC to be attached to a VF must, its passthrough property must be enabled. For details, see xref:Enabling_Passthrough_on_a_vNIC_Profile[].

.Procedure

. Click menu:Compute[Hosts].
. Click the name of an SR-IOV-capable host. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Network Interfaces* tab.
. Click *Setup Host Networks*.
. Select an SR-IOV-capable NIC, marked with a image:images/SR-IOV-icon.png[]
, and click the pencil icon.
. Optional: To change the number of virtual functions, click the *Number of VFs setting* drop-down button and edit the *Number of VFs* text field.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the number of VFs deletes all previous VFs on the network interface before creating the new VFs. This includes any VFs that have virtual machines directly attached.
====
+
. Optional: To limit which virtual networks have access virtual functions, select *Specific networks*.
.. Select the networks that should have access to the VF, or use *Labels* to select networks based on their network labels.
. Click btn:[OK].
. In the *Setup Host Networks* window, click btn:[OK].
