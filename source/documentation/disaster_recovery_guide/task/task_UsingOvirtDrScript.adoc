==== Using the `ovirt-dr` Script for Ansible Tasks

The `ovirt-dr` script is located in */usr/share/ansible/roles/oVirt.disaster-recovery/files*. This script simplifies the following Ansible tasks:

* Generating a `var` mapping file of the primary and secondary sites for failover and fallback
* Validating the `var` mapping file
* Executing failover on a target site
* Executing failback from a target site to a source site

*Usage*

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# ./ovirt-dr _generate/validate/failover/failback_
              [--conf-file=dr.conf]
              [--log-file=ovirt-dr-_log_number_.log]
              [--log-level=_DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR_]
----

You can set the parameters for the script's actions in the configuration file,  */usr/share/ansible/roles/oVirt.disaster-recovery/files/dr.conf*.

You can change the location of the configuration file with the `--conf-file` option.

You can set the location and level of logging detail with the `--log-file` and `--log-level` options.
