=== Performing Searches in {virt-product-fullname}

The Administration Portal allows you to manage thousands of resources, such as virtual machines, hosts, users, and more.  To perform a search, enter the search query (free-text or syntax-based) into the search bar, available on the main page for each resource. Search queries can be saved as bookmarks for future reuse, so you do not have to reenter a search query each time the specific search results are required. Searches are not case sensitive.
