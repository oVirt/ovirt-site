# Host Networking Api

### Owner

*   Name: Moti Asayag (masayag)
*   Email: masayag@redhat.com

## Current Status

The current host networking api (up to ovirt-engine-3.6) suffers from various limitations:

*   A mix of the physical and the logical network configuration
    -   Exposing vlan device implementation to the user
    -   Using 'Sync Network' feature requires to find the specific interface which carries the network
*   A Cumbersome request format for 'setup networks':
    -   creating vlan devices
    -   a complex input structure to represent the expected configuration
*   The attach/detach network isn't the RESTFul way to modify the interface
*   Cannot support a host only network (a network without a nic)
    -   Cannot support a dynamic (external) networks

## Proposed Solution

Introduce **<network_attachment>** element which describes how the network is configured on the host:

` `<network_attachment>
`   `<network/>
`   `<host_nic/>
`   `<ip_address_assignments/>
`   `<properties/>
`   `<reported_configurations>
`     `<in_sync>`false`</in_sync>
`     `<reported_configuration>
`       `<name>`mtu`</name>
`       `<value>`9000`</value>
`       `<in_sync>`false`</in_sync>
`     `</reported_configuration>
`     `<reported_configuration>
`       `<name>`bridged`</name>
`       `<value>`false`</value>
`       `<in_sync>`false`</in_sync>
`     `</reported_configuration>
`     `<reported_configuration>
`       `<name>`200`</name>
`       `<value>`false`</value>
`       `<in_sync>`false`</in_sync>
`     `</reported_configuration>
`   `</reported_configurations>
` `</network_attachment>

*   network - which logical network is connected to the host
*   host_nic - an optional sub-element which described the underlying interface
    -   When not provided, implies the network is a nic-less network (not supported in 3.6)
    -   Can specify an unused nic or a bond (either existing bond or bond to create from unused nics).
*   ip_address_assignments - the ip configuration (ipv4/ipv6, boot protocol and addresses)
*   properties - network custom properties
*   reported_configuration - read-only element, returned *only* when the network is out-of-sync with the logical network definition, listing the specific out-of-sync properties.

The **ip_address_assignments** representation is:

` `<ip_address_assignments>
`   `<ip_address_assignment>
           `<assignment_method>`STATIC`</assignment_method>` 
             
`     `<ip address="…" netmask="…" gateway ="…"/>
`   `</ip_address_assignment>
`   `<ip_address_assignment>
           `<assignment_method>`STATIC`</assignment_method>` 
`     `<ip address="…" netmask="…" gateway ="…"/>
`     `<ip>
`   `</ip_address_assignment>
       
         
`   `<ip_address_assignment>
           `<assignment_method>`STATIC`</assignment_method>` 
`     `<ip address="…" netmask="…" gateway ="…" version="6"/>
`   `</ip_address_assignment>
` `<ip_address_assignments>

A new **link_aggregation** element is added to abstract the implementation:

`   `<link_aggregation>
`     `<options>
             
`       `<option>
`         `<name>`module`</name>
`         `<value>`bonding`</value>
`       `</option>
`       `<option>
`         `<name>`mode`</name>
`         `<value>`1`</value>
`         `<type>`Active-Backup`</type>
`       `</option>
`       `<option>
`         `<name>`miimon`</name>
`         `<value>`100`</value>
`       `</option>
`     `</options>
`     `<slaves>
`       `<host_nic id="833ebaeb-0988-4bd5-b860-e00bcc3f576a"/>
`       `<host_nic id="782e8199-984e-407f-b242-3d6c7dc2f7b7"/>
`     `</slaves>
`   `</link_aggregation>

The link_aggregation element will be used from within the host_nic element for bonding devices.

#### Network attachments sub-collection of the nic resource

*   A collection of network attachments that are attached to a specific physical interface or a bond:

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkattachments

*   Supported actions:
    1.  **GET** returns a list of networks attached to the nic
    2.  **POST** attaches a network to the nic

#### Setupnetworks API of the host resource

*   A multi-network configuration action to support complex network settings (i.e. cross nics actions: move network from one nic to another or create network on bond)

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/setupnetworks

*   Supported actions:
    -   **POST** - expects a relative change to be applied on the host, using *PATCH* behaviour.
*   Request structure:

` `<action>
`   `<modified_bonds />
         `<removed_bonds />`    
`   `<modified_network_attachments />
`   `<synchronized_network_attachments/>
`   `<removed_network_attachments />
`   `<check_connectivity />
`   `<connectivity_timeout />
` `</action>

*   modified_bonds - describes bonds to create or to update, those bonds could be referred by name from the network_attachment element
*   removed_bonds - id list of bonds to be removed
*   modified_network_attachments - describes which networks should be configured (added or updated) on the host.
    -   When host nic is provided, the network will be configured on it
    -   When host nic is omitted, the network will be configured as a nicless network (not supported in 3.6)
    -   When a nic is changed, the network will be reconfigured on the new nic (move network from nic to nic). Network id cannot be changed from one to another as a part of update. Network can be identified by id or name just like bond.
*   removed_network_attachments - id list of network attachments to remove
*   synchronized_network_attachments - network attachment list to be synchronized with nic

#### Network attachment resource under nic

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkattachments/{networkattachment:id}

*   Supported actions:
    1.  **GET** - returns a specific network attachment; attaches network to the nic, when nic id is provided.
    2.  **DELETE** - deletes network attachment; detaches a network from the nic
    3.  **PUT** - updates the network network attachment

#### Network statistics sub-collection (optional)

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkattachments/{networkattachments:id}/statistics

*   Supported actions:
    1.  **GET** returns a specific statistics for a network attachment(if reported) which is attached to the nic

<!-- -->

*   We can implement a new API in this context to reflect the total rx/tx instead of a processed measurements.

#### Host Network attachments sub-collection

Introducing new sub-collections to reflect the host network configuration:

*   A collection of network attachments which represent how the network is provisioned on the host

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkattachments

*   Supported actions:
    1.  **GET** returns a list of networks attachments configured on the host
    2.  **POST** provision a network on the host

Where the networkattachment element will omit the host_nic element from the request. If provided, must be in sync with one provided on URL path

#### Host Network attachment resource

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkattachments/{networkattachment:id}

*   Supported actions:
    1.  **GET** returns a specific network configured on the host
    2.  **PUT** Update a network configured on the host, where modifying the nic indicates network will be configured on the new network device.
    3.  **DELETE** removes a network from the host

## Current Host Networking API (up to ovirt-engine-3.5)

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics

*   **GET** - list of network interfaces (GetVdsInterfacesByVdsId)
*   **POST** - creates a bond (AddBond)

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/setupnetworks

*   **POST** - performs setup networks action (SetupNetworks)

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}

*   **GET** - gets a specific network interface (GetVdsInterfacesByVdsId)
*   **DELETE** - removes a bond (RemoveBond)
*   **PUT** - updates a network which is attached to the specific network interface, aka mini-setup networks (UpdateNetworkToVdsInterface)

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/attach

*   **POST** - adds a network to a nic (AttachNetworkToVdsInterface)

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/detach

*   **POST** - removes a network from a nic (DetachNetworkFromVdsInterface)

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/statistics

*   **GET** - list the statistics of the specific network interface

Network labels related actions are listed at [Features/NetworkLabels#REST](/develop/release-management/features/network/networklabels/#rest).

## What should be deprecated?

*   The *network* element in host_nic is replaced by *networkattachments* subcollection:

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}:
` `<host_nic>
`   `<network />
` `</host_nic>

is replaced by:

         /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkattachments:
` `<network_attachments/>

The vlan devices will be hidden from the list of /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics and will be represented as a *networkattachment* element of the underlying nic.

*   Deprecated: /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/setupnetworks

` `<host_nics>
`   `<host_nic>
`     `<network id="..."/>
`   `</host_nic>
` `</host_nics>

Is replaced by: /api/hosts/{host:id}/hostsetupnetworks

` `<modified_network_attachments>
            ...
` `</modified_network_attachments>
       

Request should contain only nics or bonds (no vlans).

*   Deprecated Host nics actions:

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/attach
       is replaced by POST request to 
       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkattachments

and:

       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/detach
       is replaced by DELETE request to:
       /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkattachments/{networkattachment:id}

*   Updating network interface

       `**`PUT`**` on /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/
       the action semantics is changed to edit bond only

is replaced by

         `**`PUT`**` on /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkattachments/{networkattachment:id}

## Behaviour Change

Since the Network Attachment is the entity for describing a network attachment to the host, and it requires to be associated to an existing network on the data-center, unmanaged networks handling will be done differently than <= ovirt-engine 3.5.
 Unmanaged networks are networks which are reported by vdsm (hence those networks are reported by libvirt and have the expected prefix of "vdsm-"), but are not identified as networks on the cluster on which the host resides.
