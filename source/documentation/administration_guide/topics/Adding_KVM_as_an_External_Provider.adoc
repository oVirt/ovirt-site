==== Adding a KVM Host as a Virtual Machine Provider

Add a KVM host to import virtual machines from KVM to {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}.

*Adding a KVM Host as a Virtual Machine Provider*

. Enable public key authentication between the proxy host and the KVM host:
.. Log in to the proxy host and generate SSH keys for the *vdsm* user.

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# sudo -u vdsm ssh-keygen
----
+
.. Copy the *vdsm* user's public key to the KVM host. The proxy host's *known_hosts* file will also be updated to include the host key of the KVM host.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# sudo -u vdsm ssh-copy-id root@_kvmhost.example.com_
----
+
.. Log in to the KVM host to verify that the login works correctly.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# sudo -u vdsm ssh root@_kvmhost.example.com_
----
+
. Click menu:Administration[Providers].
. Click *Add*.
. Enter a *Name* and *Description*.
. Select *KVM* from the *Type* drop-down list.
. Select the *Data Center* into which KVM virtual machines will be imported, or select *Any Data Center* to specify the destination data center during individual import operations.
. Enter the URI of the KVM host in the *URI* field.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
qemu+ssh://root@host.example.com/system
----
. Select a host in the chosen data center to serve as the *Proxy Host* during virtual machine import operations. This host must also be able to connect to the network of the KVM external provider. If you selected *Any Data Center* in the *Data Center* field above, you cannot choose the host here. The field is greyed out and shows *Any Host in Data Center*. Instead you can specify a host during individual import operations.
. Optionally, select the *Requires Authentication* check box and enter the *Username* and *Password* for the KVM host. The user must have access to the KVM host on which the virtual machines reside.
. Click *Test* to test whether you can authenticate successfully with the KVM host using the provided credentials.
. Click *OK*.
