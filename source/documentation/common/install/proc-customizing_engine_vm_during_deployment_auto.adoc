= Customizing the {engine-name} virtual machine using automation during deployment

[role="_abstract"]
You can use automation to adjust or otherwise customize the {engine-name} virtual machine during deployment by using one or more Ansible playbooks. You can run playbooks at the following points during deployment:

* before the self-hosted engine setup
* after the self-hosted engine setup, but before storage is configured
* after adding the deployment host to the {engine-name}
* after the deployment completes entirely



.Procedure

. Write one or more Ansible playbooks to run on the {engine-name} virtual machine at specific points in the deployment process.

. Add the playbooks to the appropriate directory under `/usr/share/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/redhat/rhv/roles/hosted_engine_setup/hooks/`:
+
`enginevm_before_engine_setup`:: Run the playbook before the self-hosted engine setup.
`enginevm_after_engine_setup`:: Run the playbook after the self-hosted engine setup, but before storage is configured.
`after_add_host`:: Run the playbook after adding the deployment host to the {engine-name}.
`after_setup`:: Run the playbook after deployment is completed.

When you run the self-hosted-engine installer using either Cockpit or the command line, the deployment script runs the `ovirt-engine-setup` role, which automatically runs any playbooks in either of these directories.
