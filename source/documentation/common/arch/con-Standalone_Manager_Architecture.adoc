= Standalone {engine-name} Architecture

The {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} runs on a physical server, or a virtual machine hosted in a separate virtualization environment. A standalone {engine-name} is easier to deploy and manage, but requires an additional physical server. The {engine-name} is only highly available when managed externally with a product such as Red Hat's High Availability Add-On.

The minimum setup for a standalone {engine-name} environment includes:

* One {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} machine. The {engine-name} is typically deployed on a physical server. However, it can also be deployed on a virtual machine, as long as that virtual machine is hosted in a separate environment. The {engine-name} must run on {enterprise-linux} 8.

* A minimum of two hosts for virtual machine high availability. You can use {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s or {hypervisor-fullname}s ({hypervisor-shortname}). VDSM (the host agent) runs on all hosts to facilitate communication with the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}.

* One storage service, which can be hosted locally or on a remote server, depending on the storage type used. The storage service must be accessible to all hosts.
