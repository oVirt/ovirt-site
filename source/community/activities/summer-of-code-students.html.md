# Summer of Code Students

Thank you for your interest in participating in Google Summer of Code with oVirt!

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) promotes open source software development by sponsoring students to work on open source projects. If you are a student interested in developing open source software, this program is for you! Don't worry if you have not developed open source software before. We are generally looking for students who are willing to learn, have good coding skills and, most importantly, have a keen interest in open source software development.

## How to Apply

To participate in GSoC as a student, you must be an individual enrolled in an accredited post-secondary institution. No group applications are allowed. Please check [eligibility section](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) of the GSoC FAQ for more details.

Only coding projects are allowed for GSoC.

Please be sure you are familiar with answers to GSoC's [frequently asked questions](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

## Decide on a GSoC Project

You can start by reviewing the GSoC project ideas on [oVirt's ideas list](/community/activities/summer-of-code/#ovirt-ideas-for-google-summer-of-code-2018) or by looking for a listed mentor and talking to the mentor about what would be a suitable GSoC project. The ideas list is not exclusive, and you can find the main developers of any project on IRC at #ovirt on OFTC, introduce yourself, and ask about what would be a suitable GSoC project or present your idea there. Base any ideas you propose on the research about the needs of a particular project in oVirt and make sure there is a mentor interested in guiding you in implementing this idea before basing your application on it.

The following things can help you select a project and prepare your idea:

*   Read the project's web site
*   Lurk on the project's IRC channel
*   Look at the open bugs for the project in the [oVirt Bugzilla](//bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&content=oVirt&no_redirect=1&order=relevance%20desc&product=&query_format=specific)
*   Read the recent discussion on the <users@ovirt.org> mailing list

To prepare a strong proposal, you need to learn as many things as you can about what would be involved in implementing it and display that knowledge in your proposal.

A general oVirt IRC channels you can hang out on is #ovirt. Please do us favor and avoid questions like "do you think my proposal will be accepted?".

## Fill Out the Application

Once the students applications period has opened on March 12, 2018 you have to submit your application on Google's Summer of Code website. Your application must be written in English. It should contain a detailed description of your project proposal. The application form will look as following:

1.  Please connect with a possible mentor for the project you are proposing early in the application process.
2.  Please answer all of the application questions.

Please be factual and clear in answering these questions. Feel free to add anything else that is relevant for your application. Try to use correct English if possible. The selection committee understands that not all applicants speak English as their first language. Many oVirt community members speak English as their second or third language!

It is never too early to start working on your GSoC application! Note that GSoC positions can be very competitive. The key to creating a strong proposal is to propose a manageable and agreed-upon project, make a contribution to the module your proposal is related to, and write an application that clearly demonstrates your knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm.

## Selection Process

oVirt community members will be able to look at the student applications and comment on them. When the student application period is closed, a small selection committee will analyze the comments and select the projects that are, in their opinion, the best. Here are some criteria of selection: usefulness for oVirt, student's knowledge about the project, manageable timeline, demonstrated skills in prior oVirt contributions or other work, and availability of a mentor interested in guiding the project.

## How You Will Work

If your application is accepted, here are some information about how you'll integrate with our community, and what we'd like you to do:

*   You will be assigned a mentor, (s)he will provide guidance throughout the project and will judge your achievements
*   You will either have access to a git repository or create your own git repository
*   You will be subscribed to the users mailing list, as well as the mailing list for the project on which you are working
*   You can come in the IRC #ovirt channel to talk with other students and mentors (and feel free to join other channels!)
*   Although it's unlikely, you could run into problems with your assigned mentor. In this case feel free to talk to oVirt GSoC administrators.

## Licensing and Attribution

GSoC requires any code and other contributions you provide to be given under an OSI-approved license, to ensure your work is available for use by anyone in the world.

The oVirt is released under various free software licenses, generally the APLv2 (and later). Therefore you must agree that the code, ideas and all other aspects of your contributions in your entry are released under the same license as the the module you're contributing to, so that they may be included in the oVirt project.

We are very pleased to have your help and as a courtesy are happy to attribute your work in various places, for example in blog posts. We will assume you want your name mentioned unless you suggest an alias, or the desire to remain anonymous.
