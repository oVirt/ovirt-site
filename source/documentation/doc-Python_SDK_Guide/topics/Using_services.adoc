=== Using Services

After you have located a service, you can call its service methods, which send requests to the server and do the real work.

Services that manage a single object usually support the `get`, `update`, and `remove` methods.

Services that manage collections of objects usually support the `list` and `add` methods.

Both kinds of services, especially services that manage a single object, can support additional action methods.
