==== Managing Groups

You can use the `ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool` tool to manage group accounts on your internal domain. Managing group accounts is similar to managing user accounts. For a full list of group options, run `ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool group --help`. Common examples are provided in this section.


*Creating a Group*

This procedure shows you how to create a group account, add users to the group, and view the details of the group.

. Log in to the machine on which the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} is installed.
. Create a new group: 
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool group add _group1_
----
+
. Add users to the group. The users must be created already. 
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]

# ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool group add _group1_
----

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
