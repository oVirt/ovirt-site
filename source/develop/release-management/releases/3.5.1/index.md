# oVirt 3.5.1 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.5.1 release as of January 21, 2015.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization. This release is available now for Fedora 20, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6, CentOS 6.6, (or similar) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 7 (or similar).

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [previous versions release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/). 

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`# yum localinstall `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm)

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release34 package already installed on your system. You can then install ovirt-release35.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

Once ovirt-release35 package is installed, you will have the ovirt-3.5-stable repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.

If you are upgrading from oVirt < 3.4.1, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.4.1 or later. Please see [oVirt 3.4.1 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.4.1/) for upgrade instructions.

For upgrading now you just need to execute:

      # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
      # engine-setup

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install) guide.

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine) guide.

## What's New in 3.5.1?

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and CentOS 7 Support

Support for running oVirt Engine on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and CentOS 7 (or similar) has been added providing custom packaging of JBoss Application Server 7.

### oVirt Engine Extensions

More information available at [Features/AAA](/develop/release-management/features/infra/aaa/).

#### Log4J logger bridge

Log4j bridge for engine log, can be used to redirect log records to any appender log4j supports. Package name is ovirt-engine-extension-logger-log4j, documentation is available at [1](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine-extension-logger-log4j.git;a=blob;f=README;hb=HEAD).

#### LDAP Authentication and Authorization

A new LDAP implementation for ovirt-engine, replaces the legacy Kerberos/LDAP implementation. The new implementation is customizable, has greater support matrix for LDAP features and enable adding new LDAP schemes. Package name is ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap, documentation is available at [2](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap.git;a=blob;f=README;hb=HEAD).

#### Misc Authentication and Authorization utility

Extensions required mainly for enabling single signon of ovirt-engine with environments such as Kerberos. Package name is ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-misc, LDAP specific integration is documented within the ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap package [3](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap.git;a=blob;f=README;hb=HEAD#l158), and in package specific documents [4](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-misc.git;a=blob;f=README.http;hb=HEAD)[5](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-misc.git;a=blob;f=README.mapping;hb=HEAD).

### Migration of local DWH Reports to remote

For those who already upgraded from 3.4 to 3.5 a new guide is now available in the [Migration of local DWH Reports to remote](/develop/release-management/features/engine/migration-of-local-dwh-reports-to-remote/) feature page

### Hosted Engine

*hosted-engine --deploy* now uses the host's hostname as the address to use when adding it to the engine, rather than the IP address of the selected interface. This means that the hostname must be resolvable and accessible for HA migration to work, and will also show e.g. in *hosted-engine --vm-status*.

## Known issues

*   NFS startup on EL7 / Fedora20: due to other bugs ( or ), NFS service is not always able to start at first attempt (it doesn't wait the kernel module to be ready); if it happens oVirt engine setup detects it and aborts with

      [ INFO  ] Restarting nfs services
      [ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Closing up': Command '/bin/systemctl' failed to execute

Retrying (engine-cleanup, engine-setup again) it's enough to avoid it cause the kernel module it's always ready on further attempts. Manually starting NFS service (/bin/systemctl restart nfs-server.service) before running engine setup it's enough to avoid it at all.

## CVE Fixed

[CVE-2014-3561](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3561) ovirt-engine-log-collector: database password disclosed in process listing
