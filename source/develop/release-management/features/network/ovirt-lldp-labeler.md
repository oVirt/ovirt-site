# oVirt LLDP labeler

## Summary

oVirt LLDP labeler is a tool that utilizes [LLDP support](https://ovirt.org/blog/2017/11/webadmin-lldp/) 
added to oVirt in 4.2. The tool helps to some extent automate network 
configuration overhead in clusters that are managed by the labeler. 
It can be used as a separate service or as one-time tool using its cli.

### Benefit to oVirt

The labeler is a service that is capable of helping the oVirt administrator
to automate some network related tasks. According to configuration reported 
via LLDP from peer switch, the labeler is capable of labeling host network 
interface or bond interfaces together. 

### Example VLAN flow

Consider following scenario:

Engine contains logical network `vlan10` tagged as VLAN with id 10
and label `lldp_vlan_10`. Multiple hosts that have it's `eth1` 
connected to switch with VLAN id 10 configured and LLDP reporting 
enabled for the interfaces connected to the hosts. To automatically 
connect our logical network `vlan10` with the `eth1` on every host,
the administrator just needs to configure and run the labeler:

First time setup:

1) Write username and password into `/etc/ovirt-lldp-labeler/conf.d/ovirt-lldp-credentials.conf`
2) Write cluster name and API address into `/etc/ovirt-lldp-labeler/conf.d/ovirt-lldp-labeler.conf`

Repeatable invocation:

1) Run the oVirt LLDP labeler by executing `python /usr/share/ovirt-lldp-labeler/ovirt_lldp_labeler_cli.py`
  
After the labeler run, the hosts will automatically set a `lldp_vlan_10` 
label on top of the `eth1` interfaces, which results in the automatic 
connection of `eth1` with `vlan10` network, due to the matching label. 
This can be repeated every time a new host is added to the cluster, 
as well as for network changes within current hosts e.g. the switch 
port connection was switched between `eth1` and `eth2` on the host.


## Prerequisites

The labeler has to be capable of reaching the desired engine REST API and the 
`python-ovirt-engine-sdk4` in a version greater than `4.2` has to be installed.


## Limitations

Currently, only Juniper switches support reporting of the needed parameters.
The required parameters are:
* `Port VLAN`
* `Link Aggregation`

## Implementation

### Service

The labeler service is done through timers available in systemd. The timer calls
a target which executes the cli tool. The delay is one hour by default and can be 
changed in the timer specification.

### Labeler

The tool itself is divided into two parts. The labeling part and the bonding 
part, each can be enabled or disabled in the configuration file. 

Each step described below is done for each host, that is part of the cluster 
specified in the configuration file.

- The bonding part starts by fetching all LLDP available for interfaces that are 
not part of any existing bond already. The labeler is not trying to modify 
existing bonds, just to create new ones. The LLDP information is then searched 
for `Link Aggregation` capabilities. The interfaces, that are capable of 
aggregation, are grouped together by `Aggregation Link ID`. Before creating 
a bond, the interface with attached `ovirtmgmt` network is filtered out, as we 
don't want to risk losing connectivity with the host. Also, rules about which 
networks can be attached to an interface are applied. After creating bond 
candidates the last step is to re-attach all networks from slaves to the bond 
candidate. All network configurations made by the labeler are marked as 
permanent so host restart won't wipe them.


- The labeling part fetches LLDP from all non-VLAN interfaces and bond slaves.
The labeler search every interface LLDP information for `VLAN ID` tlvs. For 
every VLAN tlv, the labeler creates label candidate, in format of 
`lldp_vlan_$(VLAN-ID)`, where `$(VLAN-ID)` is substituted with VLAN id from 
the reported LLDP information. It is possible to have multiple VLAN on 
the interface, in this case, the interface ends up with multiple labels. 


## Configuration

The labeler consists of three main configuration files.
Full configuration documentation is available in the [project readme](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-lldp-labeler/blob/master/README.adoc#configuration).

First two files are usually located in `/etc/ovirt-lldp-labeler/conf.d/`. 

The `ovirt-lldp-credentials.conf` contains login information to access the 
engine API. This file is restricted with permission 0600 to prevent any
unwanted access to the file.
* `username` username for Engine
* `password` password for Engine


The `ovirt-lldp-labeler.conf` contains basic configuration. 
* `clusters` list of clusters on top of which the labeler will run
* `api_url` URL of the engine API
* `ca_file` path to certficate that should be used for API access
* `auto_bonding` switch to enable/disable auto bonding
* `auto_labeling` switch to enable/disable auto labeling

The last configuration file is the configuration of the systemd timer. It is usually
located in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` and it is called 
`ovirt-lldp-labeler.timer`. 
* `OnUnitActiveSec` The timer delay for single labeler runs.



## Testing

Run labeler under conditions below:

* Auto bonding disabled
* Auto labeling disabled
* Auto bonding and labeling enabled at the same time
* On top of hosts with VLAN interfaces
* On top of hosts with interfaces, with disabled LLDP reporting

Setup tests:

* Installation
* Security - only the ovirt-lldp-credentials.conf owner should be able to 
read/write into the config
* Service timer
