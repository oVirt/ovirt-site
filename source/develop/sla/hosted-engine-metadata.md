# Hosted engine metadata

Hosted engine agents communicate using a shared "whiteboard". Each agent can only write to a reserved section (protected by sanlock) and read the whole board.

## Files

All hosted engine files related to the shared metadata are located in /rhev:

*   /rhev/data-center/mnt/<NFS>/<DOMAIN ID>/ha_agent/hosted-engine.lockspace
*   /rhev/data-center/mnt/<NFS>/<DOMAIN ID>/ha_agent/hosted-engine.metadata

and the formats are described below.

### ha_agent.lockspace

This file holds the sanlock lockspace used to protect the reserved sections from concurrent writes. The default capacity is 2000 nodes (disk size is 1 MB) and the lockspace is initialized using:

      #!/usr/bin/env python
      import sanlock
      sanlock.write_lockspace(lockspace="hosted-engine", path=lockspace_file, offset=0)

### ha_agent.metadata

This file holds the metadata published by all hosted engine agents. It is organized into 2kiB blocks where the first 512B contains the machine readable format and the rest is used for human readable and auxiliary data. The machine readable block MUST be written and distributed across network atomically.

The first block (index 0) is used for global cluster settings. Currently only the global maintenance flag is being saved there as:

      maintenance=1

The additional blocks then contain the following fields separated by '|' character (the pipe):
