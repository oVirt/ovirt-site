==== Creating a Virtual Disk

*Image* disk creation is managed entirely by the {engine-name}. *Direct LUN* disks require externally prepared targets that already exist.

You can create a virtual disk that is attached to a specific virtual machine. Additional options are available when creating an attached virtual disk, as specified in xref:Explanation_of_Settings_in_the_New_Virtual_Disk_Window[].

*Creating a Virtual Disk Attached to a Virtual Machine*

. Click the virtual machine's name. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Disks* tab.
. Click *New*.
. Click the appropriate button to specify whether the virtual disk will be an *Image* or *Direct LUN* disk.
. Select the options required for your virtual disk. The options change based on the disk type selected. See xref:Explanation_of_Settings_in_the_New_Virtual_Disk_Window[] for more details on each option for each disk type.

You can also create a floating virtual disk that does not belong to any virtual machines. You can attach this disk to a single virtual machine, or to multiple virtual machines if the disk is shareable.
