Do you roll your eyes at “social media gurus”? Social media should save time (not suck it), but you don’t have to be a community manager or have a communications background to leverage the power of 140 characters. With a few quick and easy tips, your open source project can use social media to communicate with contributors, grow its community, and share news and announcements.Already love IRC and email lists? Great! This talk will explain how using social media – such as Twitter, G+, and Facebook – can complement those good ole reliable communication methods. You also will learn how to determine which social media accounts your project needs, what content to post (and when to post it), who to follow, and how to determine whether your approach is working. Find out how to avoid being the center of an ugly Twitter storm (or pull yourself out when it’s too late), and how to keep from being super boring or becoming a spamtastic yawn fest. Using well-known open source projects as examples, this talk will show how one account doubled its followers in three months, and a new open source project had 435 followers the week it launched. This talk provides a crash course in social media to help your project effectively manage its messages and connect with its community.

But what if there was another way to describe how virtual machines are handled in the datacenter or the cloud? In this pop-culture talk, Brian Proffitt will expain these concepts and present the idea that it’s the starships of Starfleet and the fighters of the Empire and the Alliance that can better demonstrate the complexities of virtual machine management. Datacenter VMs that scale up are more in line with the starships of Starfleet: large, dedicated ships that have an intense amount of investment, not just in the ships themselves, but in the crews that man them. These ships are multifunctional, dedicated to exploration, defense, and intergalactic troubleshooting. Laden with science labs, weaponry, and very diverse crews, these ships are designed to function autonomously in a a variety of situations.Compare that with the ships of the Empire or the Alliance. Single-purpose ships with a seemingly lower investment in crews. On the Empire side, there is very little diversity, with ships and weaponry all designed for singular purposes. Empire crews are literally cut from the same cloth, and there is very little autonomy on any scale. The Alliance is slightly better, but their ships seems aligned to counter the Empire model, and so fall into the same “disposable” model. Crew diversity is infinitely better, but the barrier to entry seems a little low (“let’s give the kid from the sticks an X-Wing fighter with no formal training!”). In many respects, these fictional universes represent how VMs are treated in the datacenter and the cloud. This talk will take a light-hearted and totally geeked-out approach to discussing VMs in modern IT environments.</p></div></div><div class='vevent talk'><h3 class='summary' id='scale13x--makers-the-next-frontier-for-open-source'><a href='#scale13x--makers-the-next-frontier-for-open-source'>Makers -- The Next Frontier for Open Source</a></h3><h4 class='location hidden'><a href='https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Los Angeles, CA' target='_blank'></a></h4><h4 class='speaker'>Ruth Suehle</h4><h4 class='time'><abbr class='dtstart' title='2015-02-22T10:00:00-07:00'>Sun 22 Feb 2015  9:00am</abbr>&ndash;<abbr class='dtend' title='2015-02-22T10:00:00-07:00'>10:00am PST</abbr></h4><div class='description'><p class='hidden speaker-hidden'><b>Speaker: Ruth Suehle</b></p><p>At a glance, the maker movement seems open source by nature, full of contributors sharing their creations and building from one another. But the reality is quite different. Many (if not most) makers are unfamiliar with open source software even as users, much less with how to implement its principles within their projects. The apparently crossover is indeed a natural fit, thought, and there is much benefit in building communities around tangible projects on open source principles. Of course, there are also different sets of challenges from those faced by software communities. New sets of legal issues arise for open hardware projects. Communities unfamiliar with the evolution of open source projects panic when their goods are cloned. There are also project management and build issues larger than those faced by software projects that only have to handle bits and bytes and not pieces and parts; however, we can see a lot of hope and gain direction from those who have been successful, from groups like the Open Prosthetics Project to the wildly successful Arduino and Raspberry Pi ecosystems. These types of communities set the example for the success of open source in maker communities, and as a result, the success of maker communities’ projects for the greater good.</p></div></div><div class='vevent talk'><h3 class='summary' id='scale13x--the-key-to-open-source-innovation'><a href='#scale13x--the-key-to-open-source-innovation'>The Key to Open Source Innovation</a></h3><h4 class='location hidden'><a href='https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Los Angeles, CA' target='_blank'></a></h4><h4 class='speaker'>John Mark Walker</h4><h4 class='time'><abbr class='dtstart' title='2015-02-20T11:15:00-07:00'>Fri 20 Feb 2015 10:15am</abbr>&ndash;<abbr class='dtend' title='2015-02-20T11:15:00-07:00'>11:15am PST</abbr></h4><div class='description'><p class='hidden speaker-hidden'><b>Speaker: John Mark Walker</b></p><p>Open Source is a phenomenon made possible by defined freedoms, managed ecosystems, and the elevation of customers to the same status as developers and vendors, leading to a world where all participants collaborate on open source projects. This innovation was a happy accident: end users were able to collaborate in this way because of the establishment of the four freedoms and the resulting managed ecosystem of open source platforms. The resulting changes in development process led to open source becoming the dominant way to innovate in software. Ultimately, open source is a victory of process, governance and agility, which are at least as important as the code. But what lessons can we take away from open source domination, especially as we push forward in the cloud era? If the four freedoms drove open source development, will they play the same role in the advancement of cloud computing? In this talk, John Mark will look at examples from the cloud computing world and history. Is the secret to innovation the creation of sound processes and good governance?</p></div></div><div class='vevent talk'><h3 class='summary' id='scale13x--storage-tiering-and-erasure-ccoding-in-ceph'><a href='#scale13x--storage-tiering-and-erasure-ccoding-in-ceph'>Storage Tiering and Erasure cCoding in Ceph</a></h3><h4 class='location hidden'><a href='https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Los Angeles, CA' target='_blank'></a></h4><h4 class='speaker'>Sage Weil</h4><h4 class='time'><abbr class='dtstart' title='2015-02-22T13:30:00-07:00'>Sun 22 Feb 2015 12:30pm</abbr>&ndash;<abbr class='dtend' title='2015-02-22T13:30:00-07:00'> 1:30pm PST</abbr></h4><div class='description'><p class='hidden speaker-hidden'><b>Speaker: Sage Weil</b></p><p>Ceph is designed around the assumption that all components of the system (disks, hosts, networks) can fail, and has traditionally leveraged replication to provide data durability and reliability. The CRUSH placement algorithm is used to allow failure domains to be defined across hosts, racks, rows, or datacenters, depending on the deployment scale and requirements. Recent releases have added support for erasure coding, which can provide much higher data durability and lower storage overheads. However, in practice erasure codes have different performance characteristics than traditional replication and, under some workloads, come at some expense. At the same time, we have introduced a storage tiering infrastructure and cache pools that allow alternate hardware backends (like high-end flash) to be leveraged for active data sets while cold data are transparently migrated to slower backends. The combination of these two features enables a surprisingly broad range of new applications and deployment configurations.This talk will cover a few Ceph fundamentals, discuss the new tiering and erasure coding features, and then discuss a variety of ways that the new capabilities can be leveraged.</p></div></div><div class='vevent talk'><h3 class='summary' id='scale13x--composing-with-containers'><a href='#scale13x--composing-with-containers'>Composing with Containers</a></h3><h4 class='location hidden'><a href='https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Los Angeles, CA' target='_blank'></a></h4><h4 class='speaker'>Ryan Jarvinen</h4><h4 class='time'><abbr class='dtstart' title='2015-02-22T13:30:00-07:00'>Sun 22 Feb 2015 12:30pm</abbr>&ndash;<abbr class='dtend' title='2015-02-22T13:30:00-07:00'> 1:30pm PST</abbr></h4><div class='description'><p class='hidden speaker-hidden'><b>Speaker: Ryan Jarvinen</b></p><p>New container-centric tools are changing the way that projects are distributed and scaled in the cloud.

The IT world has become much more developer and application-centric, automation is everywhere, and cloud computing brings a whole new scale of operations (along with new privacy and security challenges). Personal computing is giving way to mobile. And Linux and open source are everywhere — in ways we only dreamed of a decade ago. Fedora had an amazing and successful first decade, but as we looked forward, realized that we weren’t ideally positioned to meet the challenges this new world brings. Our years of hard work created a polished, capable, and amazing traditional Linux distribution, but our user and contributor communities weren’t growing. After much soul-searching on the mailing list and at our contributor conferences,we knew we had to make some changes. We also knew that we wanted to stay true to our core values — freedom, friends, features, and first — and we didn’t want to turn back on the things we’ve gotten right. So, we worked on several initiatives under the umbrella term “Fedora.next”. This includes the separate Fedora Cloud, Fedora Workstation, and Fedora Server flavors, constructed to fit specific user bases and use cases in a way we’ve never done before. And it includes a more ambitious plan to decompose the thousands of packages in the Fedora repository into modular components in a “ring” structure. It also comes with a new governance model — the consensus-based and objective-oriented Fedora Council. Matthew Miller, the Fedora Project Leader, will talk about all of these things and about where we might be going next, and will answer your questions about anything and everything Fedora related.</p></div></div><div class='vevent talk'><h3 class='summary' id='scale13x--linux-desktop-when-is-our-year'><a href='#scale13x--linux-desktop-when-is-our-year'>Linux Desktop -- When Is Our Year?</a></h3><h4 class='location hidden'><a href='https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Los Angeles, CA' target='_blank'></a></h4><h4 class='speaker'>Levente Kurusa</h4><h4 class='time'><abbr class='dtstart' title='2015-02-21T18:00:00-07:00'>Sat 21 Feb 2015  5:00pm</abbr>&ndash;<abbr class='dtend' title='2015-02-21T18:00:00-07:00'> 6:00pm PST</abbr></h4><div class='description'><p class='hidden speaker-hidden'><b>Speaker: Levente Kurusa</b></p><p>Levente’s talk will start with some information about the current Desktop market, the status of the Linux Desktop and its different environments.
