= Upgrading a Remote Database Environment from 4.0 to {virt-product-fullname} 4.3

:context: 4-0_remote_db
:4-0_remote_db:

The 4.0 compatibility version is not supported after {virt-product-fullname} 4.2. Therefore, when upgrading from {virt-product-fullname} 4.0 you must update the cluster and data center compatibility versions to at least 4.1 before upgrading the {engine-name} from 4.2 to 4.3, then update the compatibility versions again after completing the {engine-name} upgrades.

You must also update the hosts before updating the compatibility versions, but only need to do so once. The host repositories stay the same across {virt-product-fullname} versions, so the hosts will already be upgraded to the latest version after a single update.

Upgrading your environment from 4.0 to 4.3 involves the following steps:
