= Enabling FIPS in RHVH

You can enable FIPS mode when installing a Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH). Red Hat does not support switching a provisioned RHVH machine to FIPS mode.

[NOTE]
====
RHVH ships as a single system image. If you select additional security profiles whose packages are not part of this system image, it may not be possible to install them. Please see the link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}package_manifest/index[Red Hat Virtualization package manifest] for a list of packages included with RHVH.
