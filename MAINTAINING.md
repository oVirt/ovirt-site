# How to maintain the oVirt site

If you are a maintainer (contributor with commit access), you can review and merge pull requests
and assign issues to other contributors.

This section describes the typical tasks and processes to follow as a maintainer.

IMPORTANT: Because maintainers have commit access to the repository, please fork and clone
the repository and submit Pull Requests. Avoid direct commits to the main branch.
All contributions must follow the [general contribution guidelines](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on building and testing the site locally.
