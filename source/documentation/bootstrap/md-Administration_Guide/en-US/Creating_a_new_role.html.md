# Creating a New Role

If the role you require is not on Red Hat Virtualization's default list of roles, you can create a new role and customize it to suit your purposes.

**Creating a New Role**

1. On the header bar, click the **Configure** button to open the **Configure** window. The window shows a list of default User and Administrator roles, and any custom roles.

2. Click **New**. The **New Role** dialog box displays.

3. Enter the **Name** and **Description** of the new role.

4. Select either **Admin** or **User** as the **Account Type**.

5. Use the **Expand All** or **Collapse All** buttons to view more or fewer of the permissions for the listed objects in the **Check Boxes to Allow Action** list. You can also expand or collapse the options for each object.

6. For each of the objects, select or clear the actions you wish to permit or deny for the role you are setting up.

7. Click **OK** to apply the changes you have made. The new role displays on the list of roles.
