= Changing Virtual Machine Cluster Compatibility

After updating a cluster's compatibility version, you must update the cluster compatibility version of all running or suspended virtual machines by rebooting them from the Administration Portal, or using the REST API, instead of from within the guest operating system. Virtual machines that require a reboot are marked with the pending changes icon (image:../common/images/pendingchanges.png[]).

ifdef::SHE_upgrade[The {engine-name} virtual machine does not need to be rebooted.]

Although you can wait to reboot the virtual machines at a convenient time, rebooting immediately is highly recommended so that the virtual machines use the latest configuration. Any virtual machine that has not been rebooted runs with the previous configuration, and subsequent configuration changes made to the virtual machine might overwrite its pending cluster compatibility changes.

.Procedure

. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines].

. Check which virtual machines require a reboot. In the *Vms:* search bar, enter the following query:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
next_run_config_exists=True
----
+
The search results show all virtual machines with pending changes.

. Select each virtual machine and click *Restart*. Alternatively, if necessary you can reboot a virtual machine from within the virtual machine itself.

When the virtual machine starts, the new compatibility version is automatically applied.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot change the cluster compatibility version of a virtual machine snapshot that is in preview. You must first commit or undo the preview.
