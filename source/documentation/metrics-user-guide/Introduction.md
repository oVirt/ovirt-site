# Chapter 1: Introduction

The Metrics Store collects logs and metrics from oVirt. The data is transferred from oVirt to OpenShift where it is
stored and aggregated in Elasticsearch and saved in indexes. Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine that lets you perform and combine many types of searches.

Use Kibana to search, view, and interact with real-time data stored in Elasticsearch indexes. Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts and tables.

Kibana enables you to view and preempt critical problems, track system usage and resources, and even plan for future growth.

## Accessing Kibana

1. Access Kibana at https://kibana.*&lt;FQDN>*.
