DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Steven Ellis. We are potentially at an interesting tip
 ping point in the future of Free and Open Source software as more of our in
 teractions are managed by services rather than applications. Does Open Sour
 ce have a future or are we pivoting towards a services based ecosystem wher
 e the best we can hope for is some degree of Open Standards? These open sta
 ndards have no specific entity tasked with defining each of them\, yet ever
 y day we hear about Open Hardware\, Open Government\, Open APIs.What does O
 pen mean within the ecosystem you operate within\, and how can we continue 
 to be a catalyst for the journey and grow the Open Source movement when so 
 many closed outcomes are being produced from the Open Source ecosystem?This
  is a collaborative session to look unpack the issue and formulate some act
 ions that can be used by the attendees within their communities\, businesse
 s and organisations.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Steven Pousty. Everybody cares about the place (they l
 ive\, they grew up in\, they had a great vacation\, in the news….). With th
 e rise of open data\, big data tooling\, and new visualisation technology\,
  we can actually now build applications that give people new ways to explor
 e beyond “where is the closest Starbucks”. I have collected Open Data from 
 my home town (Santa Cruz\, CA) and compiled it into the beginnings of a vis
 ualization and analysis platform. The goal of this talk is to show the proc
 ess of collecting open data from disparate sources\, some of the caveats on
  being able to put them together\, general lessons learned\, and some fun v
 isualizations. I want to move past thinking about sources for open data and
  moving on to tools and lessons so you can get cracking! I want to show how
  we can enable people to gather open data and turn it to open knowledge. Da
 ta sources will be from Government (e.g. United States Geologic Survey) and
  Non-Government sources (e.g Audubon Society eBird Data) while some of the 
 tools covered will be Apache Spark\, PostGIS\, Leaflet\, and various others
 .

 et the glory\, while the band\, agent\, road crew\, and sound engineers do 
 the work? Instead of being a one-hit wonder who crashes and burns by 27\, l
 ook to Willie Nelson for inspiration. Willie’s 60+ years in the music busin
 ess offer plenty of lessons developers can apply to their own careers. Atte
 nd this fun talk to see how collaborating with a diverse mix of peo ple\, l
 earning new skills\, choosing the best tool for the job (and then improving
  on it)\, contributing to a range of communities\, and not being afraid to 
 fail have benefited Willie’s career. The talk will be fun\, but the lessons
  are practical for developers–and people who work with them–of all experien

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jason Shepherd. Recent research by Chris Frohoff and G
 abriel Lawrence has exposed gadget chains in various libraries that allow c
 ode to be executed during object deserialization in Java. They’ve done some
  excellent research\, including publishing some code that allows anyone to 
 serialize a malicious payload that when deserialized runs the operating sys
 tem command of their choice\, as the user which started the Java Virtual Ma
 chine (JVM). The vulnerabilities are not with the gadget chains themselves 
 but with the code that deserializes them.There are couple of ways in which 
 this type of attack on the JVM can be mitigated:  not deserializing untrust
 ed objects\;  not having the classes used in the ‘gadget chain’ in the clas
 spath\;  running the JVM as a non-root operating system user\, with reduced
  privileges\;  egress filtering not allowing any outbound traffic other tha
 n that matching a connection for which the firewall already has an existing
  state table entry.In this talk we’ll explore each of these in detail\, usi
 ng JBoss EAP as a example of how these mitigations can be introduced.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Richard Fontana. During the past few years\, some have
  argued that we are living in a “post-open source software” (“POSS”) era\, 
 characterized by a new generation of developers who work on public software
  projects without any effort to indicate licensing or any regard to project
  governance. One view is that this represents an increase in carelessness o
 r legal misunderstanding among developers. However\, others have suggested 
 that this behavior may be a deliberate reaction against the “permission cul
 ture” inherent in traditional approaches to open source. GitHub has been bl
 amed for this phenomenon and it has taken some measures to address it.  Thi
 s talk will explore some legal and policy issues surrounding the tendency (
 real or supposed) for developers to fail to explicitly license their code

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Nick Coghlan. For a long time\, the preferred approach
  to network service security has been the hardened bunker: define a system\
 , deploy it\, and patch it promptly when security vulnerabilities in the co
 mponents used are reported and fixed.However\, continuous integration servi
 ces and automated deployments have opened up a new model: the moving target
  that grabs new releases of dependencies almost as soon as they are availab
 le\, runs them through the CI process like any other software change\, and 
 then deploys them to production. Even if a new security flaw slips through 
 testing\, that’s considered better than being exposed to the flaws that wer
 e classified as normal bug fixes\, but actually represented security issues
 .release-monitoring.org is a shared community service born out of the Fedor
 a Infrastructure team that monitors for new upstream releases\, and emits s
 tructured events that can be used to automatically trigger appropriate foll
 ow-on action.So if you’d like to learn how to drink from the firehose\, thi
 s talk’s for you!

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: William Brown. Rust is a modern language developed by 
 Mozilla pursuing the trifecta: Safety\, Speed\, and Concurrency. With such 
 promise for the future\, how can we use this now? We are not always in the 
 beautiful open green fields\; we must contend with our existing grunty appl
 ications!389 Directory Server is based on code now more than 20 years old. 
 We cannot throw this out and replace it\, but we want the benefits Rust giv
 es us - especially for authentication and security critical code.We will ex
 plore the challenges of security in engineering\, and behaviours of the mod
 ern programmer. I will discuss why we have spiraled down a mountain of fail
 ure as an engineering discipline - and why we need tools like Rust to valid
 ate our work. I will show faults in Directory Server that could have been p
 revented with safe language techniques. Finally\, I will explore the Direct
 ory Server plugin interface\, where we have the ability to provide pure Rus
 t plugins\, allowing safe\, fast extensibility to a core piece of systems a
 uthentication. This will explore the challenges to build it\, and the desig
 n patterns needed to make sure that the rewrite of the application in Rust 
 is possible\, today.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: David Chinner. After I ran out of talent and had a hig
 h speed encounter with an immovable object in May 2016\, I needed to build 
 a new race car. The car I crashed is somewhat unique for many reasons - it’
 s a Locost Clubman. The car has a space frame chassis\, based on the origin
 al 1957 Lotus 7 designed by Colin Chapman. In the early 1990s\, Ron Champio
 n published a Haynes manual titled “Build your own sports car for as little
  as £250” which was a step by step guide to fabricating and building the en
 tire car. Essentially\, it was the source code for the car.Are the open sou
 rce 3D cad tools capable of building a complex space frame chassis? Can I g
 et an open source finite element analysis software to perform strength and 
 failure analysis and get sane results? Can I design all the parts I need an
 d send them to 3rd parties to get them laser cut\, bent\, fabricated and de
 livered to my door? Can I integrate my little CNC milling machine into thes
 e tools (i.e. CAM) so I can rapidly fabricate prototypes and iterate design
 s? If the open source tools exist\, is it even possible to make them work t
 ogether in a sane way? What tools have I had to write myself? What landmine
 s will I step on?

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Rikki Endsley. In 2016\, I adopted my first carnivorou
 s plant\, a Venus Fly Trap\, which I named Gordon. I quickly discovered tha
 t\, in addition to his ability to catch the occasional bug and get energy f
 rom the sun\, Gordon’s health was closely connected to the environment and 
 care I provided. In this talk\, I’ll draw from more than a decade of experi
 ence working with open source communities (and a few months of experience k
 eeping Gordon alive) to explain how caring for a Venus Fly Trap is much lik
 e caring for a community. Like carnivorous plants\, communities can’t be le
 ft alone to fend for themselves\, and they won’t explicitly tell you when t
 here is a problem. Communities and carnivorous plants need an energy source
 \, healthy environments\, pest control\, and occasional maintenance. Whethe
 r you’re a seasoned community gardener\, or just starting to develop your c
 arnivorous plant green thumb\, you’ll learn practical tips for nurturing he
 althy roots that grow thriving communities (… or Venus Fly Traps).

 t of different performanceaspects of their Java applications. Available met
 rics range from rawCPU and memory usage to operation of the Garbage Collect
 or and JITcompiler through to thread activity and method call/heap profiles
 .Thermostat provides a GUI view of activity of local and distributedJVMs in
  a live-view or\, alternatively\, offline for after-the-factanalysis.What T
 hermostat cannot do on its own is track events and recordstatistics that ar
 e specific to a given Java application\, at least notunless the application
  co-operates with it\, for example by publishingJMX statistics that Thermos
 tat can read\, persist and display in itsGUI. However\, that’s about to cha
 nge thanks to work Thermostatdevelopers have been doing to integrate Bytema
 n into Thermostat.Byteman is a tool which can be used to modify the behavio
 ur of Javaprograms by injecting extra Java code almost anywhere in the prog
 ram.You don’t need to recompile your program or even prepare it in advancei
 n order for this to work. You can specify changes to the program onthe comm
 and line but\, what is more amazing\, you can actually useByteman to change
  the way a program runs after startup while it isstill running.In this talk
  we will show how Thermostat can collect and visualizemetrics with Byteman’
 s help in order to better understand a specificperformance issue in a Java 
 application.

 or verylittle runtime overhead and work on the object level (the compilerpr
 ovides/proofs the size of the object buffer size). valgrind memcheckprovide
 s similar memory buffer overflow checks. These checks don’t needany compile
 r help (you won’t have to rebuild your code). But they havea much higher ru
 ntime overhead. They also work on a different level.valgrind memcheck doesn

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Martin Sivák. The workloads and scenarios for virtual 
 machines grow more complexevery year. So do the interactions\, availability
 \, and performancerequirements. All that requires the administrators to car
 efully planwhere to start the VMs that depend on each other and/or specific
  hosts.This talk will present the concepts that allow the administrator toe
 xpress the rules for affinity between virtual machines and betweenvirtual m
 achines and hosts to form complex relationships that willcover for example:
   licensing rules - limiting group of VMs to only use certain hosts  overhe
 ad - web + database VMs running together  performance - eg. storage VMs run
 ning on hosts with better IOperformance  failover recovery - VMs returning 
 to “their” hosts  reservation - There is place for only one of us!oVirt is 
 an open source project for managing virtual data centers thatwill now help 
 the administrator with exactly the above tasks. We haveintroduced the virtu
 al machine affinity feature in the past and a hugeimprovement in that area 
 is coming right now.And the best part is that all this works in a fully dyn
 amic environmentwith automatic conflict resolution and no manual management
  of hostpinning rules\, saving the administrator his precious time.

 e complexity of serversis increasing even faster.To fight this\, we’ve star
 ted to work on TLS test framework thathopefully we’ll later be able to turn
  into a dedicated TLS protocolfuzzer. Currently we have a battery of tests 
 for obscure and not soobscure bugs as well as general RFC compliance.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Nathaniel McCallum. Increased uses of cryptography in 
 web environments\, particularlyauthentication\, have driven a set of new RF
 Cs: JSON Object Signing andEncryption. While these standard data formats ha
 ve dominated web-basedapplications\, they also have further applicability i
 n a wide variety ofnon-web contexts. This talk will introduce you to José\,
  a plug-able\,open source C implementation of these RFCs which provides bot
 h an APIfor direct integration and a usable command-line interface. We will
 discuss the techniques that we used to keep our API usable across allthe po
 ssible input parameters and show example of how you can implementJosé in yo
 ur own infrastructure. We will also discuss some of our plansfor the future
 \, including how you can help contribute.

 failures do happen. Complainingabout instability might not always be enough
 . Especially when yoursystem depends on multiple networked services and eac
 h of them is on acritical path to the final result.This talk will follow a 
 real story of an attempt to implement networkerrors handling by retries fun
 ctionality that is inside urllib3 andrequests Python libraries. More import
 antly we will simulate poornetwork conditions on a local machine using Linu
 x Network Emulator andthen will reason on how effective the attempt was and
  what can befurther improved.This is a proper treatment the networked syste
 ms should get when theyare designed\, developed and tested. And it is great
  that all the toolsnecessary are already there in most popular Linux distri

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Victor Stinner. Working on optimizations is a task mor
 e complex than expected on thefirst look. Any optimization must be measured
  to make sure that\, inpractice\, it speeds up the application task. Proble
 m: it is very hardto obtain stable benchmark results.The stability of a ben
 chmark (performance measurement) is essential tobe able to compare two vers
 ions of the code and compute the difference(faster or slower?). An unstable
  benchmark is useless\, and is a risk ofgiving a false result when comparin
 g performance which could lead tobad decisions.I’m gonna show you the Pytho
 n project “perf” which helps to launchbenchmarks\, but also to analyze them
 : compute the mean and the standarddeviation on multiple runs\, render an h
 istogram to visualize theprobability curve\, compare between multiple resul
 ts\, run again abenchmark to collect more samples\, etc.The use case is to 
 measure small isolated optimizations on CPython andmake sure that they don’
 t introduce performance regression in term ofperformance.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Orit Wasserman. In this session we cover two aspects o
 f live migration:  We discuss the work of moving the execution of outgoing 
 live migrationto a separate dedicated thread in QEMU.  Using a separate thr
 ead for live migration reduces contention with theIO thread and vcpus which
  results in higher throughput and more reliabledowntime.We analyze Live Mig
 ration performance state:  Performance on very large guests and the issues 
 we encounter with sucha guest. This discussion will include convergence and
  actual downtime(compared to user configured downtime).  Live migration eff
 ects on the running guest (downtime and performanceimpact on the guest work
 load)  Resource consumption (network bandwidth and CPU usage)For more infor

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Lucas Meneghel Rodrigues. KVM autotest is a large set 
 of functional and performance tests for KVM(both kernel and userspace). The
  design goals of the project were toprovide infrastructure to perform exten

 ever\, during the last couple of years\, we’ve been working on bringingthe 
 benefits of this flexible test framework for developers\, afundamentally di
 fferent use case. This required re-thinking thestructure of the project.Thi
 s presentation aims to show the work that has been done in making thetests 
 more approachable and useable for KVM developers:  Separation of tests from
  autotest core  Exposing APIs for convenient use on external test scripts  
 Abstract concepts that are not entirely necessary for a casualdeveloper to 
 make use of autotest (such as configuration files)We’ll talk about what was
  done and what’s on the pipeline\, with a demo.For more information\, inclu

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Paolo Bonzini. QEMU (and hence KVM) has long supported
  thin provisioning\, through bothsparse raw files and image formats such as
  qcow2. However\, there areseveral limitations in the implementation of thi
 s feature\, which make itmuch less effective as the lifetime of a virtual m
 achine image grows.This talk will cover how thin provisioning can help both
  virtual machineand host administrators\, as well as when/how it can be use
 d now. It willalso present a plan for making this feature more generally\, 
 effectivelyand easily usable.This talk is aimed at system administrators an
 d developers. Whilerelevant concepts will be introduced during the talk\, s
 ome familiaritywith storage technology is expected.For more information\, i

 rFS for scale-out storagemanagement of KVM disk images. GlusterFS creates n
 etwork attachedstorage on commodity hardware\, including features for elast
 icallyadding/removing nodes and georeplication. Recent improvements inGlust
 erFS and KVM make it easy to run VM disk images on GlusterFSvolumes. We als
 o focus on GlusterFS architecture and how it could beextended for virtualiz
 ation-specific needs.Previous experience with KVM or GlusterFS is not neces
 sary\, but ageneral understanding of virtualization and disk images is requ

 performance and the costs ofthe virtualization system is largely dependent 
 on the decisions thiscomponent makes. JBoss Drools can help us to make the 
 decision logicmore readable and easier to extend by specifying rules rather
  thantrying to rewrite an existing algorithm. This approach promises better
 performance for your private could through better decisions.For more inform

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Atin Mukherjee. Gluster is a open source scalable dist
 ributed storage system which can run in any commodity hardware. GlusterD is
  the daemon which manages the cluster configuration for Gluster.GlusterD wa
 s originally designed as a single threaded application which could handle j
 ust one transaction at a time. It was made multi-threaded to improve respon
 siveness and support handling multiple transactions at a time. This was nee
 ded for newer features like volume snapshots which could leave GlusterD unr
 esponsive for some periods of time.Making GlusterD multi-threaded required 
 the creation of a thread synchronization mechanism\, to protect the shared 
 data-structures (mainly everything under the GlusterD configuration\, glust
 erd_conf_t struct) from concurrent access from multiple threads. This was a
 ccomplished using the Big-lock.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Andrew Haley. Imagine you receive a report of a bug wh
 ich causes a segfault (i.e. amemory exception) in the HotSpot Java VM very 
 occasionally. This bugonly occurs about one time in ten\; it might take man
 y hours before ithappens. It has only been observed when running one partic
 ular piece ofproprietary software. It only seems to occur on one large mach
 ine whenrunning many concurrent threads and a huge heap. There is a clue: i
 tonly seems to happen when running the parallel scavenge garbagecollector. 
 But you’ve no real idea of how the garbage collector works.This happened to
  me in 2015. I’m used to being able to find and fixbugs\, but this one resi
 sted all of my attempts for a long time. As faras I can recall it’s the mos
 t difficult bug I’ve ever fixed. In huntingthis bug I used every tool avail
 able to me as a HotSpot developer. I’lldescribe them and how they were used
 .We don’t much talk about debugging. Many of us spend much of our timedoing
  it\, but not talking or writing about this important activity. Weshould ta
 lk about it more. If there’s time it would be good to swap warstories.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mario Torre. Thermostat has evolved a log way from bei
 ng a specialised tool forperformance monitoring and analysis of the JVM\, f
 irst by encompassing ageneric framework for performance analysis and data v
 isualisation andnow with the addition of a powerful and advanced new Platfo
 rminfrastructure that also allow users to build completely standaloneprojec
 ts.The Platform offers a familiar environment that handles Model View andCo
 ntrollers objects\, presentation layer\, threading models\,visualisation an
 d also special effects\, and a new data architecture.In this presentation w
 e will demonstrate how to build an applicationbased on Thermostat in few si
 mple steps and how to take advantage ofthe new architecture to build stunni
 ng and visually appealingapplications.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Andrew Dinn. BMUnit is the package which integrates By
 teman into JUnit and TestNG\,enabling you to locally redefine the behaviour
  of application or JDKruntime code for the duration of a single test or gro
 up of relatedtests. BMUnit is very simple to use\; just add a few annotatio
 ns to yourtest classes and place a few jars in your classpath. This talk wi
 llexplain how BMUnit works by presenting and executing tests whichexemplify
  the 3 most common use cases:-injecting trace code so you can be sure your 
 tests enter the expectedcode paths-injecting validation rules so you can as
 sert that specific outcomes dooccur-injecting ‘faults’ to modify state or c
 ontrol flow\, driving theapplication or JDK runtime down the path needed to
  exercise a desiredtest scenario(Please note that this talk replaces ‘Displ
 aying Application Events inThermostat Using Byteman’)

 to run an executable\, they alsolike to know that it runs efficiently\, tha
 t it doesn’t use unnecessaryresources and if it crashes and burns they want
  to collect the piecesand inspect what went wrong. So a package should also
  provide the userwith a means to easily profile\, trace and debug what is r
 unning ontheir system. This means a distro should also package symbols\,deb
 uginfo and sources for easy/automatic installation. With differentdistros a
 nd different versions of distro packages running next to eachother in conta
 iners we need some standard conventions to identifyexecutables (build-id) a

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mario Torre\, Martijn Verburg\, Dalibor Topić. OpenJDK
  is now a well established Free Software Ecosystem\, with avibrant Communit
 y and lots of interesting stuff going on\, withprojects\, repositories\, bu
 g database and above all experiments!This is exciting and fun\, but given t
 he challenges of such massiveproject\, it is intimidating and it is easy to
  get lost. It is also easyto forget that such massive infrastructure requir
 es well defined rules\,that are sometime perceived as blocking rather than 
 aiding theparticipation. To help people wanting to contribute keep track of
  thisintricate forest of development and find their way in\, the AdoptionGr
 oup was created (http://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/).This session is 
 an exchange between few of the hackers directlyinvolved with the Adoption G
 roup and the public\, we will answerquestions the audience may have in rela
 tion to getting involved withOpenJDK\, try to define and explain workaround
 s for most common problems(and blockers!) that newcomers face\, discuss som
 e of the projects weare currently involved with\, and hope to be your Ariad
 ne’s thread towin back the fun of contributing and participating at all lev
 els\,without ever getting lost!

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Omer Frenkel. The oVirt Project is an open virtualizat
 ion project providing afeature-rich server and desktop virtualization manag
 ement platform\, andCloud-Init is multi-distribution package that handles e
 arlyinitialization of a cloud instance. Recently those were integratedtoget
 her to allow users and administrators easily apply automatedconfiguration a
 nd initialization on vms using oVirt. In this session\,Omer will give short
  introduction to these projects and describe thework that has been done int
 egrating them\, including some technicalexplanation. In addition\, Omer wil
 l describe how to use Cloud-Init withoVirt and will give use-case examples\
 , and discuss what else need to bedone.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Pavel Šimerda. People have benefited from using Networ
 kManager on laptops and otheruser-facing systems for years\, long before I 
 joined the project. But thelast year of development primarily focused on se
 rver and virtualizationuse cases\, whose requirements are entirely differen
 t. Pavel Šimerda willspeak about the vast architectural changes NetworkMana
 ger is undergoingto support all of the currently considered use cases. We w
 ill also talkabout the actual features that can (and often will) be backed 
 by thearchitecture. While some of them require modification of NetworkManag
 ercode\, many can be done with the scripting capabilities or NetworkManager
 API/CLI. Interoperability with specific other software like unbound anddnss
 ec-trigger will be discussed as well.

  virtualization infrastructurethat is enabling organizations to deploy more
  rapidly on a singlecommodity hardware platform for both compute and storag

  with OpenSource software. This presentation provides an overview of what a
 converged infrastructure solution looks like and then digs into the OpenSou
 rce software that can be used to build successful convergedsolutions. With 
 Gluster and oVirt as foundational software packages thepresentation will di
 g into advanced scenarios for deploying virtualmachines as well as adding a
 dditional nodes for both storage andcompute. OpenStack networking\, image m

 thermore\, PaaS also means that platform changes canhappen without affectin
 g developers\, a big win for architects andprocurement officers. In short\,
  PaaS is for everyone. This session willhelp attendees understand how the P
 aaS landscape is evolving to providesolutions with appeal across many facet

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mikołaj Izdebski and Stanislav Ochotnický. Java packag
 ing in Linux has never been trivial. Partially due to strictprinciples that
  most Linux distributions adhere to\, partially due toJava ecosystem encour
 aging behavior which goes against these principles\,but mostly due to ineff
 ective tooling on both sides of the fence.Over past 2 years\, tooling and g
 uidelines for packaging Java havechanged in Fedora Linux considerably. What
  used to be a 1000 line buildscript can soon become 100 lines of mostly met
 adata. But all of thatrelies on sane build system with predictable behavior
  on Java side:Maven.During the course of the talk we will clean up one such
  build script anddescribe how each change was made possible. Most important
 ly we hope toconvince the audience that for common good\, using Maven for J
 avadevelopment even with all its quirks is better than the alternatives. Aw
 ider discussion on Java build systems would also be welcome.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Andrew Haley and Andrew Dinn. ARM’s new\, 64 bit ARMv8
  architecture\, is a break from the past in tworegards. The change of scale
  from 32 to 64 bit implies a broadening ofARM’s target market from (mostly)
  embedded devices to address therequirements of high end consumer devices a
 nd servers. The 64 bit mode(AArch64) programming model is significantly dif
 ferent from the existing32 bit model.If ARM’s change of direction does inde
 ed grab a significant share ofthis market then there are two corresponding 
 implications for the FreeJava community. We need a high quality free Java i
 mplementation toensure that the market is not colonised solely by commercia
 l Javavendors. We need to provide this implementation from scratch rather t
 hantry to modify existing 32 bit Java implementations.Red Hat has decided t
 o port OpenJDK to AArch64 precisely to meet theseimplications head on.This 
 talk will describe the significant progress we have made in portingOpenJDK 
 to AArch64 since the project began in earnest in July 2012\, eventhough rea
 l hardware is not yet available and will not be for manymonths to come.Duri
 ng the talk we will:  Outline our plan for converting the runtime JIT compo
 nents of OpenJDK togenerate AArch64 code – the (generated AArch64 code) tem
 plateinterpreter and the C1/C2 JIT compilers  Explain how we have already m
 anaged to execute and debug generated ARMcode using our own ARMv8 functiona
 l simulator integrated into an x86 JVM  Display execution of a Java program
  using the template interpreterrunning on our simulator  Show both ARM inst
 ruction-level and Java bytecode-level stepping anddebugging of generated co

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Radek Pazdera. In this presentation\, we would like to
  introduce a tool we have beenworking on for the last couple of months. Our
  main goal is to makenetworking tests and reproducers as automated and port
 able as possible.Testing network stacks requires a fair amount of configura
 tion to bedone on multiple machines. The configuration itself is a part of 
 thetest. However\, it is often highly dependent on the environment andunfor
 tunately\, when the environment changes (due to move to a differenthardware
 /site\, changes in the addressing\, or simply updates of theoperating syste
 m) the configuration often breaks.With LNST\, we try to overcome these prob
 lems of transferring networkconfiguration between different environments. W
 e will demonstrate theideas and the concepts we are working with\, as well 
 as the features thatare a part of Linux Network Stack Test.Project website:

  Hotspot andLLVM) and started implementing a couple of significant improvem
 ents.This talk will give a short summary about what Zero and Shark actually
 are\, how they work\, why they are relevant (even in the face of upcomingfu

 d then describe some of the more interesting details aboutwhat I did\, in p
 articular improved support for atomic operations\, JSR292/invokedynamic\, i

 re popping up on every streetcorner\, it becomes increasingly important to 
 prevent vendor lock-in.Several efforts are already underway in projects lik
 e Deltacloud to helpabstract away the differences in APIs and allow consume
 rs to be cloudagnostic.However\, the desire for cloud agnosticism becomes i
 ncreasinglychallenging when we start thinking about managing images. Not on
 ly do wehave API differences\, but also many cloud vendors require differin
 gformats and importation methods\, some requiring uploading of pre-builtima
 ges\, others snapshots of running instances.This talk addresses some of the
  issues surrounding image management in afederated cloud environment and in
 troduces Aeolus Image Factory\; aproject that offers image management abstr
 action for multitude of Cloudvendors. Aeolus Image Factory allows users to 
 define images at a highlevel and have them built\, pushed and registered wi
 th all the majorcloud vendors.

 theirrelationships in a single template\, launch everything with one comman
 dand keep it up. You can easily combine the workflow with existingconfigura
 tion management tools such as Puppet or Chef.Initially modeled after Amazon
  CloudFormation\, Heat is a free and opensource component for OpenStack and
  has recently been accepted intoOpenStack incubation.This session will prov

 ady have anunderstanding of the core features and architecture of libvirt. 
 Thistalk will thus focus on a selection of recently developed features ando
 f some of the other important\, but less well known\, features oflibvirt.Th
 e talk will be targeted at virtualization application developers usinglibvi
 rt\, with a bias towards those using KVM or LXC. At the end of thetalk the 
 audience will better understand how to take advantage oflibvirt for their d
 evelopment needs.

  input andgraphics device management.This talk looks at the work being done

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Langdon White. For many years the Linux distro concept
  has been about “inclusion ofapplications” sometimes at the detriment to co
 -habitating applicationsand the stability of the core OS. Much discussion h
 as been made over theyears about JEOS\, embedded Linux\, custom distros\, a
 pplicance building\,etc\, but not a lot of discussion about how application
 s could bedelivered such that they were more readily able to co-habitate. O
 n arelated note\, open source applications (because distros are so“inclusiv
 e”) are put through significant scrutiny around their designand deployment 
 related to their integration with the core OS that may ormay not make sense
 . The scrutiny is certainly more intense thanproprietary software is requir
 ed to undergo. This talk proposes anew’ish technology\, Software Collection
 s\, as a method for resolution.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Assaf Muller. Join me for an architectural\, developer
  oriented overview of (GRE andVXLAN) tunnels in OpenStack Networking.In the
  virtualization environment virtual machines are hosted onhypervisors. Thes
 e VMs then obtain network connectivity via softwareswitches run in the same
  hypervisors. Data centers that provideinfrastructure as a service have (ho
 pefully) multiple customers (Or‘tenants’). As you can imagine we don’t want
  tenants’ VMs interactingwith one another.VLANs are a natural approach to a
 chieve tenant segregation. However\, howdo we maintain scalability with a g
 rowing number of hypervisors and VMs\,when the administrator has to constan
 tly configure the hardware switchesmanually? Is there another way?We all us
 e VPNs to connect to our office resources remotely\, or toconnect two offic
 e sites into one seamless network. VPNs are essentiallyencrypted tunnels\, 
 but what are tunnels?Tunnels allow us to wrap packets inside more packets. 
 In our context -VM traffic in exterior IP packets. That way\, to the interm
 ediatenetworking hardware\, it looks like traffic between the hypervisors.S
 ince the hypervisors should already be able to talk to each other\, thismak
 es VM connectivity a breeze!Let’s explore how tunnels are used in the cloud
  as a means to achieve anoverlay network. What is an overlay network? How d
 oes traffic flowbetween virtual machines on the same hypervisor\, and on di
 fferenthypervisors? What are the similarities between a layer 2 learning sw
 itchand tunnel logic in OpenStack? How does Open vSwitch fit in? Is there a
 cost to using tunnels?This talk will be useful to developers interested in 
 learning about newnetworking concepts - Minimal background knowledge will b
 e assumed.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Nicolas Dandrimont\, Pierre-Yves Chibon. Fedmsg\, the 
 federated message bus\, is a distributed system allowing bitsof a project’s
  infrastructure to publish events. This lightweightframework provides a cen
 tral place to watch the life of a project\, andallows anyone to listen in a
 nd trigger actions when an event isreceived.Initially built by the Fedora I
 nfrastructure team to uniformisecommunication between its services\, the Fe
 dmsg framework has now beenadopted by Debian and even outside the realm of 
 Linux distributions tobroadcast events. All those deployments are using the
  same framework\,and the same tools\, fostering the ever-needed interoperab
 ility andcollaboration between free software and open data projects.In this
  talk\, we will present how fedmsg works\, how it was deployed inthe Fedora
  and Debian infrastructures\, and some of the technical choicesthat were ma
 de during those deployments. We will also present theapplications being dev
 eloped around the bus\, as well as some ideas forfuture ones.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Roy Golan. The oVirt project allows efficient manageme
 nt of virtualizeddatacenters. Deciding what machine should host a certain V
 M is one ofthe important functions of the management platform. Unfortunatel
 y it isalso one of the complex ones\, because there can be many rules gover
 ningthe placement policy and there is a time limit in which a VM has to bes
 tarted or migration initiated. Till now each VM was consideredseparately an
 d that caused fragmentation of free resources.We are about to present a new
  solution to this issue in thispresentation. We have started a cooperation 
 with the OptaPlanner teamthat develops an optimization engine based on prob
 abilistic (softcomputing) algorithms. This means that oVirt will feed situa
 tion updatesto an optimization service and continuously receive improved so
 lutionsback. It will then use the precomputed results for rebalancing thecl
 usters.

 S and then it quicklybecame a cloud provider. But what does that mean? What
  is a cloudprovider suppose to provide? What’s cloud after all?Scaling a di
 stributed system goes beyond virtualization\, shared storageetc. In order t
 o support on-demand scaling it is necessary to have aneasy way to provision
  and consume the available infrastructure\, a wayfor the services running i
 n it to communicate\, etc. Not to mentionlatency needs\, reliability\, etc.
 This talk aims to answer the above questions and take a step furtherdown th
 e path of explaining what should be considered essential fornowadays needs\
 , especially when those needs require a cloud to becovered.

 g on. Luckily\, a group ofpeople is actually working full-time on making it
  a better project.Contributors often scratch their own itches\, and move on
 .This talk is meant to give you an overview about areas of Foreman thatbadl

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Lukas Berk. Software development rarely has “spare” ti
 me\, which often forcesdevelopers to stick to the tools they already know. 
 Having any sort oflearning curve can be a barrier to entry for debugging an
 d performancetools\, even when the payoffs are worth the time invested lear
 ning newtools. The Linux Tools Project aims to improve the state of C/C++de
 velopment on the Eclipse IDE by integrating popular tools\, such asValgrind
 . This integration allows developers to maintain an environmentthey’re fami
 liar with\, yet leverage new development tools.This talk is aimed at people
  of varying experience with the Valgrindtool who have never used it within 
 the Eclipse IDE.

 re\, install Fedora (or anyother distribution) and configure it using stand
 ard linux tools. This isnot possible at the moment primarily because of lac
 k of unified andconsistent platforms and driver interfaces. We are working 
 to changethat.The current state of support for switch chips in Linux is not
  good. Eachvendor provides userspace binary sdk blob that only works with t
 heirchips. Each of this blobs has proprietary APIs. To get switch chipsprop
 erly supported there’s need to introduce a new infrastructuredirectly into 
 Linux kernel and to work with vendors to adopt it.This talk presents the cu
 rrent effort to unify and uphold the Linuxnetworking model across the spect
 rum of devices which is necessary tomake Linux the cornerstone of industria
 l grade networking. The scope ofthis talk covers state of art with current 
 implementation of standardcommodity switches such as top of rack switches\,

 of the very first external projects to land inthe OpenJDK repository and sp
 onsored by the OpenJDK Porters Group. Namedafter a delicious cheese we’re n
 ever tired of eating\, it had theoriginal purpose of refactoring the AWT pe
 ers to allow differentimplementations to be added to OpenJDK. The project e
 volved very quicklyuntil it became itself a full implementation of AWT base
 d on Swing withjust enough abstraction to allow custom plugging into the Ja
 va2D systemfor rendering. As time passed\, this characteristic was used to 
 implementa GUI testing framework running on offscreen buffers to avoid the 
 usualproblems of focus stealing and random mouse moving that plague everyot
 her GUI testing framework (here everything is emulated!)\, and finallya ful
 l Web based backend to allow application to run remotely but stillbe visibl
 e on the local screen. This talk will cover the progress wehave done over t
 he years\, we will show how easy is to implement a newbackend and how this 
 project could be used to give Wayland support toOpenJDK. We will show the t
 esting framework and finally we will discussabout WebJDK\, an idea to give 
 more web oriented functionality to OpenJDKand use the web backend to enable
  fully cloud based applications.

 is space by providing a central space toprovision and manage your container
 s and your network\, as we already dowith your data center. This provides a
  great framework for mixedenvironments where physical machines\, vms\, and 
 containers are all usedin conjunction. Orchestration through Kubernetes is 
 being implemented atthe moment.Monitoring\, deploying\, and everything else
  is possible to do through theweb UI or an API\, and it’s open source\, so 
 if you miss any feature\, feelfree to add it!

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Severin Gehwolf. OpenJDK comes with a zero assembler p
 ort called Zero. Back in 2009 whenZero was originally developed by Gary Ben
 son\, OpenJDK was available onlyon x86\, x86_64 and SPARK. Despite recent J
 IT ports\, such as the AArch64and ppc/aix port\, Zero still remains relevan
 t for many Linuxdistributions. For example\, at Red Hat we build and use th
 e OpenJDK zerovariant on PPC/PPC64 and s390/s390x. What’s more it’s a usefu
 l tool forgetting new JIT ports built from source using free software.This 
 talk will give a brief summary what Zero is and how it works. Itwill cover 
 some of the recently discovered issues with sustaining theZero port\, how w
 e try to catch them early and it will explain ourexperience with pushing fi
 xes upstream. There will also be examples howthis effort benefits the OpenJ
 DK ecosystem as a whole.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Andrew Haley. We’ve been working on OpenJDK for a long
  time now and we’ve gained a lotof experience working on the code itself an
 d\, perhaps more importantly\,working with the Java team inside Oracle. Thi
 s talk is about ourexperiences trying make one of the largest ever external
  contributionsto OpenJDK\, the AArch64 port.I’ll talk about how the OpenJDK
  contribution process works\, and how itdoesn’t work\, and how important it
  is to gain the trust of people insideOracle’s Java team. I’ll discuss the 
 strange asymmetry of being anexternal contributor to a project but not bein
 g able to know all of whatis going on. I’ll try my best to explain the baff
 ling role of Projectsand JEPs. I’ll speculate about the future of OpenJDK a
 nd how it mustchange as more people outside Oracle contribute significant s
 labs ofcode\, and how we must have more external patch reviewers.Finally\, 
 I’ll open up the floor for discussion. I’m sure we’ll have alot to talk abo
 ut.

  new GC algorithm designed to address this issue. We takea simple approach 
 that allows us to do more work while your Java programis running so we can 
 substantially reduce the time the JVM is paused.Our goal is to be able to g

 o you roll your eyes at “social media gurus”? Social media should save time
  (not suck it)\, but you don’t have to be a community manager or have a com
 munications background to leverage the power of 140 characters. With a few 
 quick and easy tips\, your open source project can use social media to comm
 unicate with contributors\, grow its community\, and share news and announc
 ements.Already love IRC and email lists? Great! This talk will explain how 
 using social media – such as Twitter\, G+\, and Facebook – can complement t
 hose good ole reliable communication methods. You also will learn how to de
 termine which social media accounts your project needs\, what content to po
 st (and when to post it)\, who to follow\, and how to determine whether you
 r approach is working. Find out how to avoid being the center of an ugly Tw
 itter storm (or pull yourself out when it’s too late)\, and how to keep fro
 m being super boring or becoming a spamtastic yawn fest. Using well-known o
 pen source projects as examples\, this talk will show how one account doubl
 ed its followers in three months\, and a new open source project had 435 fo
 llowers the week it launched. This talk provides a crash course in social m
 edia to help your project effectively manage its messages and connect with 
 its community. (* Drinking the social media Kool-aid not required.)

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Brian Proffitt. The difference between the scale up mo
 del used in virtual datacenter management tools like oVirt and vSphere and 
 the cloud’s scale out model used in OpenStack and CloudStack has historiall
 y used the pets versus cattle model. But what if there was another way to d
 escribe how virtual machines are handled in the datacenter or the cloud? In
  this pop-culture talk\, Brian Proffitt will expain these concepts and pres
 ent the idea that it’s the starships of Starfleet and the fighters of the E
 mpire and the Alliance that can better demonstrate the complexities of virt
 ual machine management. Datacenter VMs that scale up are more in line with 
 the starships of Starfleet: large\, dedicated ships that have an intense am
 ount of investment\, not just in the ships themselves\, but in the crews th
 at man them. These ships are multifunctional\, dedicated to exploration\, d
 efense\, and intergalactic troubleshooting. Laden with science labs\, weapo
 nry\, and very diverse crews\, these ships are designed to function autonom
 ously in a a variety of situations.Compare that with the ships of the Empir
 e or the Alliance. Single-purpose ships with a seemingly lower investment i
 n crews. On the Empire side\, there is very little diversity\, with ships a
 nd weaponry all designed for singular purposes. Empire crews are literally 
 cut from the same cloth\, and there is very little autonomy on any scale. T
 he Alliance is slightly better\, but their ships seems aligned to counter t
 he Empire model\, and so fall into the same “disposable” model. Crew divers
 ity is infinitely better\, but the barrier to entry seems a little low (“le
 t’s give the kid from the sticks an X-Wing fighter with no formal training!
 ”). In many respects\, these fictional universes represent how VMs are trea
 ted in the datacenter and the cloud. This talk will take a light-hearted an
 d totally geeked-out approach to discussing VMs in modern IT environments.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Ruth Suehle. At a glance\, the maker movement seems op
 en source by nature\, full of contributors sharing their creations and buil
 ding from one another. But the reality is quite different. Many (if not mos
 t) makers are unfamiliar with open source software even as users\, much les
 s with how to implement its principles within their projects. The apparentl
 y crossover is indeed a natural fit\, thought\, and there is much benefit i
 n building communities around tangible projects on open source principles. 
 Of course\, there are also different sets of challenges from those faced by
  software communities. New sets of legal issues arise for open hardware pro
 jects. Communities unfamiliar with the evolution of open source projects pa
 nic when their goods are cloned. There are also project management and buil
 d issues larger than those faced by software projects that only have to han
 dle bits and bytes and not pieces and parts\; however\, we can see a lot of
  hope and gain direction from those who have been successful\, from groups 
 like the Open Prosthetics Project to the wildly successful Arduino and Rasp
 berry Pi ecosystems. These types of communities set the example for the suc
 cess of open source in maker communities\, and as a result\, the success of
  maker communities’ projects for the greater good.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: John Mark Walker. Open Source is a phenomenon made pos
 sible by defined freedoms\, managed ecosystems\, and the elevation of custo
 mers to the same status as developers and vendors\, leading to a world wher
 e all participants collaborate on open source projects. This innovation was
  a happy accident: end users were able to collaborate in this way because o
 f the establishment of the four freedoms and the resulting managed ecosyste
 m of open source platforms. The resulting changes in development process le
 d to open source becoming the dominant way to innovate in software. Ultimat
 ely\, open source is a victory of process\, governance and agility\, which 
 are at least as important as the code. But what lessons can we take away fr
 om open source domination\, especially as we push forward in the cloud era?
  If the four freedoms drove open source development\, will they play the sa
 me role in the advancement of cloud computing? In this talk\, John Mark wil
 l look at examples from the cloud computing world and history. Is the secre
 t to innovation the creation of sound processes and good governance?

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Sage Weil. Ceph is designed around the assumption that
  all components of the system (disks\, hosts\, networks) can fail\, and has
  traditionally leveraged replication to provide data durability and reliabi
 lity. The CRUSH placement algorithm is used to allow failure domains to be 
 defined across hosts\, racks\, rows\, or datacenters\, depending on the dep
 loyment scale and requirements. Recent releases have added support for eras
 ure coding\, which can provide much higher data durability and lower storag
 e overheads. However\, in practice erasure codes have different performance
  characteristics than traditional replication and\, under some workloads\, 
 come at some expense. At the same time\, we have introduced a storage tieri
 ng infrastructure and cache pools that allow alternate hardware backends (l
 ike high-end flash) to be leveraged for active data sets while cold data ar
 e transparently migrated to slower backends. The combination of these two f
 eatures enables a surprisingly broad range of new applications and deployme
 nt configurations.This talk will cover a few Ceph fundamentals\, discuss th
 e new tiering and erasure coding features\, and then discuss a variety of w
 ays that the new capabilities can be leveraged.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Matthew Miller. As the Fedora Project reached its 10th
  birthday\, we starting looking at how computing has changed since we start
 ed\, and what we need to do to stay relevant\, useful\, and engaging. The I
 T world has become much more developer and application-centric\, automation
  is everywhere\, and cloud computing brings a whole new scale of operations
  (along with new privacy and security challenges). Personal computing is gi
 ving way to mobile. And Linux and open source are everywhere — in ways we o
 nly dreamed of a decade ago. Fedora had an amazing and successful first dec
 ade\, but as we looked forward\, realized that we weren’t ideally positione
 d to meet the challenges this new world brings. Our years of hard work crea
 ted a polished\, capable\, and amazing traditional Linux distribution\, but
  our user and contributor communities weren’t growing. After much soul-sear
 ching on the mailing list and at our contributor conferences\,we knew we ha
 d to make some changes. We also knew that we wanted to stay true to our cor
 e values — freedom\, friends\, features\, and first — and we didn’t want to
  turn back on the things we’ve gotten right. So\, we worked on several init
 iatives under the umbrella term “Fedora.next”. This includes the separate F
 edora Cloud\, Fedora Workstation\, and Fedora Server flavors\, constructed 
 to fit specific user bases and use cases in a way we’ve never done before. 
 And it includes a more ambitious plan to decompose the thousands of package
 s in the Fedora repository into modular components in a “ring” structure. I
 t also comes with a new governance model — the consensus-based and objectiv
 e-oriented Fedora Council. Matthew Miller\, the Fedora Project Leader\, wil
 l talk about all of these things and about where we might be going next\, a
 nd will answer your questions about anything and everything Fedora related.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Fatih Degirmenci\, Yolanda Robla Mota. This talk will 
 explain the tight relationship between the OpenStack andOPNFV communities\,
  using as a base the Cross Community CI project\, andthe benefits that both
  communities get from it.Initially the OPNFV CI was based on the consumptio
 n of stableartifacts\, including stable versions of OpenStack. Developers w
 ere notable to work with master versions\, causing lack of testing and dela
 y ondelivering projects.Cross Community CI project (XCI) enabled testing ba
 sed on masterversions of the different upstream components (OpenStack \,Ope
 nDaylight…). This caused to significantly cut the time ofdevelopment and id
 entify bugs earlier.In this talk we will introduce that concept\, and we wi
 ll also explainthe tooling used to achieve it (bifrost\, openstack-ansible\
 ,ansible-opendaylight)\, showing how a deployment goes from end to end\,how
  to reuse this project for your own needs\, and how to startintegrating you
 r own project into XCI if that fits into the scope.

 the“network provider for OVN”\, which uses OVN through an OpenStackNeutron-
 like API\, allowing the use of OVN through Neutron abstractions.This concep
 t is already being used in the oVirt project\, and there’swork in progress 
 to implement it in the ManageIQ projectThe session will look into utilising
  Software Defined Network conceptsin a virtualization project through the o

 Ceph clusters for object and block storageand want to use the same cluster 
 for shared file services as well as tothose more generally interested in Ma

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Andrew Dinn. The OpenJDK JVM eats class bytecode and s
 pits out Java heap objects andmachine code as part of normal execution. How
 ever\, the JVM manages moredata than just bytecode\, Java objects JITted co
 de. In order to manageheap memory and to ensure correct execution\, the JVM
  and JITted codeneed to retain and\, occasionally\, interrogate details of 
 the loadedclass base. Bytecode is not a very ‘efficient’ representation for
  thispurpose\, nor does it include details of runtime-derived info like cla
 ssand method implementation dependencies\, compile history and JITted codes
 tatus\, or execution profiles.So\, the JVM throws away most bytecode after 
 parsing\, in its placeconstructing and maintaining its own ‘efficient’ in-m
 emory (C++) datastructures which model both the loaded class and method bas
 e andruntime-derived state. This is what is known as Class Metadata. ClassM
 etadata is a significant component of the Native Memory storageallocated an
 d managed by the JVM\, alongside JIT Compiler Metadata\, GCMetadata\, Threa
 d Metadata\, etc. For small applications that don’tcreate a large number of
  Java objects Metadata can constitute a largeportion of a Java application’
 s resident memory set.This talk will begin by describing how to use the jcm
 d tool to measuresummary JVM Native Memory storage costs\, including overal
 l ClassMetadata costs. It will also show how to use jcmd to obtain a detail
 edbreakdown of the latter costs\, splitting the overheads along two axes:fi
 rstly\, by class\; and secondly\, dividing per-class costs into separatesub
 -costs associated with different component subsets of the classmodel: class
 es per se\, constant pools\, methods and annotations.I will go on to explai

 gy usage the operatingsystem needs to make efficient use of the hardware. L
 inux supports alot of hardware power-saving features\, but many of them are
  disabled bydefault because they cause problems on certain devices or in ce
 rtain\,often corner-case\, circumstances. This talk will describe and look 
 intorecent efforts to enable more power-saving features by default in sucha
  way that this will not cause regressions. The end goal of theseefforts is 
 to shave of at least 2 watt of the typical idlepower-consumption of 6-9 wat
 t for recent (Hasswell or newer) laptops.The goal is to achieve this saving
  on an OOTB Fedora Workstationinstall without the user needing to do any ma

 ect more storage devicesand use them efficiently. Cinder has been solving t
 his use case inOpenstack for a long time and can be integrated with any kub
 ernetescluster regardless of its cloud provider. By deploying a standalonec
 inder service and a new external provisioner to a cluster\, pods canaccess 
 almost any volume that cinder is able to provision. Complexoperations such 
 as cloning\, snapshots\, and migration become services ofthe cluster. This 
 presentation will describe and demonstrate a cinderexternal provisioner\, e
 numerate its advantages\, discuss challengesespecially around deployment\, 
 and propose collaboration opportunitiesbetween Openstack and kubernetes.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Martin Polednik. Assigning a host device to a VM is co
 mmonly supported task byvirtualization management software. Because of perf
 ormance requirementsof modern workloads\, the same could be said for contai
 ner orchestrationtools. But it is not the same assignment - as VM and conta
 iners havevarying degree of isolation\, it is done at different system laye
 rs. Howcould we bring device assignment to infrastructure that handles both
 VMs and containers\, such as KubeVirt?The talk aims to * introduce KubeVirt
 \, a Kubernetes add-on to managevirtual machines\, * give overview of devic
 e assignment in Kubernetesand in VM management software oVirt\, * present a
 n idea of combiningthese two.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Maor Lipchuk. Even the best system administrator canno
 t always avoid any and everydisaster that may plague his data center\, but 
 he should have acontingency plan to recover from one - and an administrator
  thatmanages his virtual data centers with oVirt is of course no different.
 This session will showcase how Ansible can be used to leverage the newAPIs 
 introduced in oVirt 4.2 to create a fully-fledged DR strategy.
