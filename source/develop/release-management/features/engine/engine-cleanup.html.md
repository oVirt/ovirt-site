# engine-cleanup

## Engine Cleanup (Work in progress)

### Summary

This utility is intended to bring the host to a state it can be reused by oVirt engine

### Owner

This should link to your home wiki page so we know who you are

*   Name: TBD (MyUser)

Include you email address that you can be reached should people want to contact you about helping with your feature, status is requested, or technical issues need to be resolved

*   Email: TBD

### Present

(To be replaced to a link when a design page is created)

      * Drop DB - works both on local and remote
      * Remove keystore (not perfect)
      * cleanup symlinks
      * stop services (jbossas, notifer)
      * non-interactive switch -u/--unattended, default is drop DB.
      * switch: -d/--dont-drop-db

### Absent

Missing to comply with the purpose definition:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      * Default mode is interactive - asking if to drop DB or not.
        Message: Drop data base? if you want to reuse the existing database for the future installation choose no.
      * Message at the end: Finished cleanup it is now safe to rerun engine-setup.
      * If it did not dropped DB add: Note that after re-install you'll have to run Hosts re-install/re-approve
      * Add -h/--help
      * Add message (Hide all options except -d/-u/-h in the usage message/help)

### Detailed Description

The cleanup should provide:

1. Reset a failed installation to a state in which you can safely rerun: engine-setup

2. Clean up before a new installation before or after the user has run:

      # yum remove

and the later tries it a second time without a formal clean-up being performed

* Meaning the sequence I (first example) :

      # engine-cleanup
      # yum remove ovirt-engine
      # yum install ovirt-engine
      # engine-setup 

* Or the sequence II (second example):

      # yum remove ovirt-engine,
      # yum install ovirt-engine
      # engine-cleanup
      #  engine-setup

* If sequence II is not possible, don't start cleanup at all, but exit with proper message.

3. Reset an existing installation without dropping DB.

* Use cases: fix failed upgrade or a corrupted installation

* Next required 'Manual' steps:

      # yum remove engine
      # yum install engine
      # engine-setup   # This script should know how to reuse an existing DB, and to perform an upgrade if necessary

Note 1: The above includes Reports and DHW

Note 2. This utility is not intended to leave the machine clean for other application to reuse - only to be reused by a oVirt Manager

Note 3: Preserve DB is not intended to relocate db from local to remote and vice versa - Need to provide a procedure to do that.

Note 4: It will not remove any local NFS export, including the one it created during last installation. If we wish for engine-setup to reuse, this is enhancement to for engine-setup.

### Benefit to oVirt

This feature saved the need to re-install the host OS if a re-install of the engine is required. Currently in some cases even an initial installation failure may require clean install

### Dependencies / Related Features

### Documentation / External references

The clean-up script should be idempotent. If not, it needs a bug filed noting the deficiency. That is, one should be able to repeatedly run:

      # engine-cleanup
      # engine-cleanup
      # engine-cleanup # ... 

with no additional changes occurring on the second and following runs, beyond what occurred on the first, and supplementation of the log files
