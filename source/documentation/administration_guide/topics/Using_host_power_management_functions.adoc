==== Using Host Power Management Functions


When power management has been configured for a host, you can access a number of options from the Administration Portal interface. While each power management device has its own customizable options, they all support the basic options to start, stop, and restart a host.


*Using Host Power Management Functions*

. Click menu:Compute[Hosts] and select the host.
. Click the *Management* drop-down menu and select one of the following *Power Management* options:

* *Restart*: This option stops the host and waits until the host's status changes to `Down`. When the agent has verified that the host is down, the highly available virtual machines are restarted on another host in the cluster. The agent then restarts this host. When the host is ready for use its status displays as `Up`.

* *Start*: This option starts the host and lets it join a cluster. When it is ready for use its status displays as `Up`.

* *Stop*: This option powers off the host. Before using this option, ensure that the virtual machines running on the host have been migrated to other hosts in the cluster. Otherwise the virtual machines will crash and only the highly available virtual machines will be restarted on another host. When the host has been stopped its status displays as `Non-Operational`.

[NOTE]
====
If Power Management is not enabled, you can restart or stop the host by selecting it, clicking the *Management* drop-down menu, and selecting an *SSH Management* option, *Restart* or *Stop*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When two fencing agents are defined on a host, they can be used concurrently or sequentially. For concurrent agents, both agents have to respond to the Stop command for the host to be stopped; and when one agent responds to the Start command, the host will go up. For sequential agents, to start or stop a host, the primary agent is used first; if it fails, the secondary agent is used.
