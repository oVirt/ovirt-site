==== Changing the FQDN of a Host

Use the following procedure to change the fully qualified domain name of hosts.


*Updating the FQDN of a Host*

. Place the host into maintenance mode so the virtual machines are live migrated to another host. See xref:Moving_a_host_to_maintenance_mode[] for more information. Alternatively, manually shut down or migrate all the virtual machines to another host. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#Manually_migrating_virtual_machines[Manually Migrating Virtual Machines] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_ for more information.
. Click *Remove*, and click btn:[OK] to remove the host from the Administration Portal.
. Use the `hostnamectl` tool to update the host name. For more options, see link:{URL_rhel_docs_legacy}html/Networking_Guide/ch-Configure_Host_Names.html[ Configure Host Names] in the _{enterprise-linux} 7 Networking Guide_.
