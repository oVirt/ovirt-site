=== Service Level Agreement Policy Enforcement

This procedure describes how to set service level agreement CPU features.

*Setting a Service Level Agreement CPU Policy*

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines].
. Click *New*, or select a virtual machine and click *Edit*.
. Click the *Resource Allocation* tab.
. Specify *CPU Shares*. Possible options are *Low*, *Medium*, *High*, *Custom*, and *Disabled*. Virtual machines set to *High* receive twice as many shares as *Medium*, and virtual machines set to *Medium* receive twice as many shares as virtual machines set to *Low*. *Disabled* instructs VDSM to use an older algorithm for determining share dispensation; usually the number of shares dispensed under these conditions is 1020.

The CPU consumption of users is now governed by the policy you have set.
