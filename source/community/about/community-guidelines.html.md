# Community guidelines

We want to keep the oVirt Community a great place to participate, but we need your help to keep it that way. While we have specific guidelines for various tools, in general, you should:

*   Be nice
*   Keep it clean
*   Keep it legal
*   Stay on topic

## General guidelines

### Search before you ask

A few seconds on Google can help you find an answer to a question, or a past discussion on a subject, which can help us reduce duplication of effort and any associated frustration. Your effort will be appreciated.

<form action="https://google.com/search" class="">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-3">
<select class="form-control" name="as_q">
<option value="site:lists.ovirt.org OR (site:bugzilla.redhat.com ovirt)">Lists & bugzilla</option>
<option value="site:lists.ovirt.org">Lists only</option>
<option value="(site:bugzilla.redhat.com ovirt)">Bugzilla only</option>
</select>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6" style="padding:0">
<input name="q" class="form-control">
</div>
<div class="col-xs-3">
<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Search Google</button>
</div>
</div>
</form>

### Be pleasant

Our community is defined by the interactions of its members. When people are nice to each other, our community is nice. It can be easy to forget, in a disconnected world, that the person behind the IRC nick is a person. Please remember that.

For each of the communication channels the community uses, there are some channel-specific guidelines.

## Mailing list guidelines

*   Keep it short - an email to a mailing list is asking a lot of people for their time to read it. Please be concise.
*   Send email to the right place - please only send email which is on-topic for the list(s) receiving it. You can find a description of the most important community mailing lists on the [mailing lists](mailing lists) page.
*   Cross-posting is accepted in the oVirt project when appropriate - if you want to ask a question which is relevant to project developers, which will need support of the infrastructure team, then cross-posting to arch@ovirt.org and infra@ovirt.org is fine.

## IRC guidelines

*   We hold IRC meetings in the oVirt project - please see [meetings](meetings) for the agenda for team meetings. During meetings, please respect meeting participants and stay on-topic. We use [MeetBot](http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot) to generate meeting minutes - if you would like to assist with minute taking, you can request "chair" status from the meeting leader.
*   Please use [fpaste](http://fpaste.org/) or [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) if you would like to share long texts (longer than ~3-4 lines)
*   Answer questions if you can - don't be shy about answering questions, even if the answer is "I don't know". It is always helpful, and like many IRC channels, there can be long periods when not many people are around. So you might be the only person to see the question in real time.
*   Use someone's IRC nick when talking to them. Many IRC clients highlight messages which include their IRC nick, making it easier for them to see when someone has something specific to ask them.
*   Be patient - when asking questions, be aware that perhaps no-one is around. Sometimes answers will arrive only after a few minutes.

## Wiki contribution guidelines

*   Wiki page naming - Please use descriptive, complete titles for page names. Please do not use CamelCase, All Capital Initials or sentences. Proper nouns or acronyms should be capitalised correctly.
    -   Example: "Compiling VDSM" is good, "Feature/DetailedNetworkWiring" could be "Feature/Detailed network wiring", "Engine Adding Messages" could be "Adding messages to Engine"
    -   For more details on page naming, refer to <Help:Wiki_structure>.
*   Writing style - please explain acronyms, keep your writing style correct but informal, and try to avoid jargon where possible.
*   Sub-pages: We discourage the use of sub-pages, with very few exceptions ("Features" is one).

In general, we try to follow the [Wikipedia Style Guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide), where appropriate.

## Bug reporting guidelines

*   Before reporting your bug, please [search the bug tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/query.cgi?product=oVirt) to see if it has been reported already. A comment added to an existing bug report is also very useful.
*   To report an issue with oVirt, you first need [an account on our bug tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi).
*   Once you have confirmed your email address and are logged in, you can [create a bug against the oVirt product](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=ovirt).
*   If you know which component is causing your problem, then choose that component. Otherwise, if your problem is related to a hypervisor node, choose the "ovirt-node" component. If it is related to the engine, choose "ovirt-engine-core". If you are unsure, choose "ovirt-engine-core", and one of the oVirt developers will reassign the bug for you.
*   When commenting on bugs, please bear in mind that the bug reporter may not know the project as well as possible. If a bug has been reported against the wrong component or product, or if the behaviour observed is expected, please be kind in your comments and explain any changes you make. If you feel the report is not a bug, try to figure out why the expected behaviour is causing problems for the reporter, and suggest a work-around.
*   Above all, be nice. Bug trackers can be emotional places. Separate the person from the problem.

## Code submission guidelines

oVirt uses [Gerrit](http://gerrit.ovirt.org) to manage code submissions.

*   To get started, follow the instructions for [working with oVirt Gerrit](working with oVirt Gerrit)
*   When reviewing a patch, if you are unsure whether the code meets project standards, do not score the patch "-1" or "+1".
*   In comments please be considerate toward the work which the patch submitter has done to submit the patch.
*   For patch submitters: Please familiarise yourself with project coding conventions before submitting a patch. Here are the [Backend Coding Standards](Backend Coding Standards) for all the project parts.

Coding conventions for [ VDSM](Vdsm Developers#Code_Style) are in the wiki, and are included in [ the Maven build process](Building oVirt Engine/IDE) for oVirt Engine.
