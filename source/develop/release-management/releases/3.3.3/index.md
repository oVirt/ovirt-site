# oVirt 3.3.3 release notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.3.3 release

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features that were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [oVirt 3.3.2 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.3.2/), [oVirt 3.3.1 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.3.1/), [oVirt 3.3 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.3/), [oVirt 3.2 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.2/), and [oVirt 3.1 release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.1/).

For a general overview of oVirt, read [the oVirt 3.0 feature guide](/develop/release-management/releases/3.0/feature-guide/) and the [about oVirt](/community/about.html) page.

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you're upgrading from a previous version please update ovirt-release to latest version (10) and ensure you've **ovirt-3.3.3** and **ovirt-stable** repository enabled.

      # yum update ovirt-release
      # yum repolist enabled

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3, you should just execute:

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
      # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2, you should read [oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade](/develop/release-management/releases/3.2/to-3.3-upgrade/)

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1, you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.3. Please read [oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade](/develop/release-management/releases/3.1/to-3.2-upgrade/) before starting the upgrade.
 On CentOS and RHEL: For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need the 3.2 stable repository.
So, the first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

      [ovirt-32]
      name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
`baseurl=`[`http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/`](/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/)
      enabled=1
      skip_if_unavailable=1
      gpgcheck=0

Then

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup

should install ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.
Then:

      # engine-upgrade

this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
      # engine-setup

will upgrade to latest 3.3.

## What's New in 3.3.3?
