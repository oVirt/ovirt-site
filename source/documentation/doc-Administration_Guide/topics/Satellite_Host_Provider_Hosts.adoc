=== Satellite Host Provider Hosts

Hosts provided by a Satellite host provider can also be used as virtualization hosts by the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. After a Satellite host provider has been added to the {engine-name} as an external provider, any hosts that it provides can be added to and used in {virt-product-fullname} in the same way as {hypervisor-fullname}s ({hypervisor-shortname}) and {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s.
