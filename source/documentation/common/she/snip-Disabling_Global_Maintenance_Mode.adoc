= Disabling Global Maintenance Mode

.Procedure

. Log in to the {engine-name} virtual machine and shut it down.

. Log in to one of the self-hosted engine nodes and disable global maintenance mode:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=none
----
+
When you exit global maintenance mode, ovirt-ha-agent starts the {engine-name} virtual machine, and then the {engine-name} automatically starts. It can take up to ten minutes for the {engine-name} to start.

. Confirm that the environment is running:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# hosted-engine --vm-status
----
+
The listed information includes **Engine Status**. The value for **Engine status** should be:
+
----
{"health": "good", "vm": "up", "detail": "Up"}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When the virtual machine is still booting and the {engine-name} hasn't started yet, the **Engine status** is:
----
{"reason": "bad vm status", "health": "bad", "vm": "up", "detail": "Powering up"}
----
If this happens, wait a few minutes and try again.
