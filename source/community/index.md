## Developers

If you'd like to contribute code to oVirt, visit the [Developer section](/develop/) of the site for guidelines.
All of our projects use git and are hosted at [https://github.com/oVirt](https://github.com/oVirt/).

## Testing

We're always eager to have new contributors to the [oVirt Quality Assurance](/develop/qa/index.html) project, no matter your experience level.
If you'd like to get involved with helping to make oVirt better, read the [QA project page](/develop/qa/index.html) to find out how to join in with QA activities.
There are tasks available for every level of expertise and available spare time.

## Translate

oVirt's user interface and documentation are available in multiple languages for users around the globe.
Examples include Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and more.
To contribute translations, please follow our [How-To](/develop/localization.html).

## Documentation

oVirt needs concise, user-friendly, up-to-date installation and usage documentation. To contribute, visit the [documentation repository](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/tree/main/source/documentation) and the [documentation issues tracker](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation). You can also report any documentation issues you find by clicking "Report an issue with this page" at the bottom of the documentation.

## Report Bugs and New Feature Requests (RFEs)

Reporting bugs is one of the most valuable ways you can contribute! Ideas for new features are also very welcome. Report bugs and RFEs using the following issue trackers:

- [Bugzilla - how to report a bug](/community/report-a-bug.html)
- [VM Portal GitHub - bugs and RFEs in VM Portal](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-web-ui/issues)
- [oVirt Documentation GitHub - Documentation issues](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation)
- Security issues follow a [special reporting procedure](/community/security.html).

## Monitor security reports for oVirt Node

oVirt Node contains hundreds of packages: some of them may be affected by vulnerabilities which may have critical impact.
You can help keeping oVirt Node secure by monitoring [security reports](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=product%3A%22security%20response%22)
and open oVirt Node trackers using [Bug 2074469](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2074469) as template.

Once the tracker is open you can help monitoring progress of the security fix.
Look at [existing security reports in oVirt Node](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=product%3Aovirt-node%20keyword%3Asecurity)
and check corresponding package on [CentOS Stream 8 Koji](https://koji.mbox.centos.org/koji/packages).
If a fix for the CVE is available, update Bugzilla accordingly. As an example you can see [Bug 2074469 handling](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2074469#c1)

## Participate in the oVirt infrastructure

Our project infrastructure can always benefit from extra people, hardware and network bandwidth.
First of all, consider [hosting a public mirror](/community/get-involved/repository-mirrors.html) of oVirt repositories.
You can also [become an infra team member](/community/becoming-an-infrastructure-team-member.html) or [donate GitHub runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) to the project to improve our capacity and redundancy.
