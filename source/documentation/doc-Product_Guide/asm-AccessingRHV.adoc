== Accessing {virt-product-fullname}

{virt-product-fullname} exposes a number of interfaces for interacting with the components of the virtualization environment. Many of these interfaces are fully supported.
ifdef::rhv-doc[]
Some, however, are supported only for read access or only when your use of them has been explicitly requested by Red Hat Support.
endif::[]

=== Supported Interfaces for Read and Write Access

Direct interaction with these interfaces is supported and encouraged for both read and write access:

*Administration Portal*:: The Administration Portal is a graphical user interface provided by the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. It can be used to manage all the administrative resources in the environment and can be accessed by any supported web browsers.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#[_Administration Guide_]

*VM Portal*:: The VM Portal is a graphical user interface provided by the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. It has limited permissions for managing virtual machine resources and is targeted at end users.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}introduction_to_the_vm_portal/index#[_Introduction to the VM Portal_]

*Cockpit*:: In {virt-product-fullname}, the Cockpit web interface can be used to perform administrative tasks on a host. It is available by default on {hypervisor-fullname}s, and can be installed on {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s.


*REST API*:: The {virt-product-fullname} REST API provides a software interface for querying and modifying the {virt-product-fullname} environment. The REST API can be used by any programming language that supports HTTP actions.
+
See: link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}rest_api_guide/index[_REST API Guide_]

*Software Development Kit (SDK)*:: The Python, Java, and Ruby SDKs are fully supported interfaces for interacting with the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}.
+
See:

* link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}python_sdk_guide/index#[_Python SDK Guide_]

* link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}java_sdk_guide/index#[_Java SDK Guide_]

* link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}ruby_sdk_guide/index#[_Ruby SDK Guide_]

*Ansible*:: Ansible provides modules to automate post-installation tasks on {virt-product-fullname}.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#chap-Automating_RHV_Configuration_using_Ansible[Automating Configuration Tasks using Ansible] in the _Administration Guide_.

*Self-Hosted Engine Command Line Utility*:: The `hosted-engine` command is used to perform administrative tasks on the {engine-name} virtual machine in self-hosted engine environments.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#administering_the_manager_virtual_machine[Administering the {engine-name} Virtual Machine] in the _Administration Guide_.

*VDSM Hooks*:: VDSM hooks trigger modifications to virtual machines, based on custom properties specified in the Administration Portal.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#appe-VDSM_and_Hooks[VDSM and Hooks] in the _Administration Guide_.


=== Supported Interfaces for Read Access

Direct interaction with these interfaces is supported and encouraged only for read access.
ifdef::rhv-doc[]
Use of these interfaces for write access is not supported unless explicitly requested by Red Hat Support.
endif::[]

*{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} History Database*:: Read access to the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} history (`ovirt_engine_history`) database using the database views specified in the _Data Warehouse Guide_ is supported. Write access is *not* supported.


*Libvirt on Hosts*:: Read access to *libvirt* using the `virsh -r` command is a supported method of interacting with virtualization hosts. Write access is *not* supported.


=== Unsupported Interfaces

Direct interaction with these interfaces is *not* supported
ifdef::rhv-doc[unless your use of them is explicitly requested by Red Hat Support]
:

*The `vdsm-client` Command*:: Use of the `vdsm-client` command to interact with virtualization hosts is *not* supported
ifndef::rhv-doc[.]
ifdef::rhv-doc[ unless explicitly requested by Red Hat Support.]

*{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} Database*:: Direct access to, and manipulation of, the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} (`engine`) database is *not* supported

====
Red Hat Support will not debug user-created scripts or hooks except where it can be demonstrated that there is an issue with the interface being used rather than the user-created script itself.
