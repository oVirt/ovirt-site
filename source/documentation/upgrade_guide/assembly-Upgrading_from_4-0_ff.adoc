= Fast-forwarding {virt-product-fullname} from 4.0 to 4.3

:context: 4-0_local_db_ff
:4-0_local_db_ff:

{virt-product-fullname} 4.3 and later does not support 4.0 cluster compatibility version or data center compatibility version. So when you upgrade from {virt-product-fullname} 4.0, you must update the cluster and data center compatibility versions to at least 4.1 before you upgrade the {engine-name} from 4.2 to 4.3. Then, if you want to use the 4.3 compatibility version, update the compatibility versions again after completing the {engine-name} upgrades.

You must also update the hosts before updating the compatibility versions, but only need to do so once. The host repositories stay the same across {virt-product-fullname} versions, so the hosts will already be upgraded to the latest version after a single update.

Upgrading your environment from 4.0 to 4.3 involves the following steps:

. xref:Upgrade_Prerequisites_4-0_local_db_ff[Make sure you meet the prerequisites.]

. xref:Upgrading_with_ovirt-fast-forward-upgrade_4-0_local_db_ff[Run `ovirt-fast-forward-upgrade`.]

. xref:Changing_the_Cluster_Compatibility_Version_4-0-4-2_local_db_ff[Update the compatibility version of the clusters to 4.2.]

. xref:Changing_Virtual_Machine_Cluster_Compatibility_4-0-4-2_local_db_ff[Reboot any running or suspended virtual machines to update their configuration to 4.2.]

. xref:Changing_the_Data_Center_Compatibility_Version_4-0-4-2_local_db_ff[Update the compatibility version of the data centers to 4.2.]

. Return to `ovirt-fast-forward-upgrade` and continue the upgrade. The tool upgrades the {engine-name} to 4.3.

. xref:Changing_the_Cluster_Compatibility_Version_4-0_local_db_ff[Update the compatibility version of the cluster to the latest version.]

. xref:Changing_the_Data_Center_Compatibility_Version_4-0_local_db_ff[Update the compatibility version of the data centers to the latest version.]

The tool enables the proper repositories and upgrades the {engine-name} to 4.2.

If the tool detects that the cluster compatibility version is set to 3.6 or 4.0, the tool pauses and prompts you to manually upgrade the cluster compatibility version to at least 4.1.

[WARNING]
====
If you try to continue without upgrading the cluster compatibility version to at least 4.1, `ovirt-fast-forward-upgrade` aborts.
====

You must now update the hosts before you can update the cluster and data center compatibility versions.
