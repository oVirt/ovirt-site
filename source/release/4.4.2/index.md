# oVirt 4.4.2 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.2 Second Release Candidate as of August 06, 2020.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and
CentOS Linux 8.2 (or similar).

To find out how to interact with oVirt developers and users and ask questions,
visit our [community page](/community/).
All issues or bugs should be reported via
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).

The oVirt Project makes no guarantees as to its suitability or usefulness.
This pre-release should not to be used in production, and it is not feature
complete.


If you'd like to try oVirt as quickly as possible, follow the instructions on
the [Download](/download/) page.

For complete installation, administration, and usage instructions, see
the [oVirt Documentation](/documentation/).

For a general overview of oVirt, read the [About oVirt](/community/about.html)
page.

[release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).

## RELEASE CANDIDATE

In order to install this Release Candidate you will need to enable pre-release repository.

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release44-pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release44-pre.rpm)



## What's New in 4.4.2?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1749803](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1749803) **[RFE] Improve workflow for storage migration of VMs with multiple disks**

   Feature: 

Allow setting the same target domain for multiple disks at

once on the move/copy popup.



Reason:

Currently, while moving/copying multiple disks, the user is required to set the target domain for each disk separately, one by one.



Result: 

For multiple selected disks, if a common target domain exists, it can be set as the target domain for all those disks at once by selecting it from the list.



In case a common storage domain doesn't exist, or setting a different target domain for part of the disks,

(so not all disks will be moved/copied to the same storage domain), the common target domain would be set as 'Mixed'.

 - [BZ 1837873](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1837873) **[RFE] No warning/blocking when detaching storage domain when there are VMs with disk on the detached domain and second disk on other domain**

   Feature: 

Warn on detaching a storage domain having VMs/templates with disks on another storage domain.



Reason:

When a user wants to detach a storage domain that contains

VMs/templates, their disks should be moved to a storage domain used for migration.

Currently, when that entity also has multiple disks on a different storage domain, its future migration might get complicated and split into two partial entities instead. 



Result:

In order to avoid the entity's split, a new warning was added in that case while confirming the SD detach.

 - [BZ 1819260](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1819260) **[RFE] enhance search filter for Storage Domains with free argument**

   This RFE was resolved by 



1) change "size" to "free_size"

2) add "total_size" to the search engine options

3) change "used" to "used_size"

4) adding "(GB)" when displaying 1-3 above  



for example , you can use now the followingf from the storage domains TAB



"free_size > 6 and total_size < 20"
