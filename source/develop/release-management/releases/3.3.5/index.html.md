# oVirt 3.3.5 release notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.3.5 release

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [oVirt 3.3.4 release notes](oVirt 3.3.4 release notes), [oVirt 3.3.3 release notes](oVirt 3.3.3 release notes), [oVirt 3.3.2 release notes](oVirt 3.3.2 release notes) , [oVirt 3.3.1 release notes](oVirt 3.3.1 release notes), [oVirt 3.3 release notes](oVirt 3.3 release notes), [oVirt 3.2 release notes](oVirt 3.2 release notes) and [oVirt 3.1 release notes](oVirt 3.1 release notes). For a general overview of oVirt, read [ the oVirt 3.0 feature guide](oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide) and the [about oVirt](about oVirt) page.

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

oVirt 3.3.5 release is available. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.3 stable repository.

      # yum 
`# yum localinstall `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.3.5/package-pool/ovirt-release-11.2.0-1.noarch.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.3.5/package-pool/ovirt-release-11.2.0-1.noarch.rpm)
      # yum-config-manager --enable ovirt-3.3-stable

Since oVirt 3.4.0 has been released, in order to install 3.3.5 instead of 3.4.0 you need to disable latest stable and latest 3.4 repositories:

      # yum-config-manager --disable ovirt-stable
      # yum-config-manager --disable ovirt-3.4-stable

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

If you're installing oVirt 3.3.5 on a clean host you should read our [Quick Start Guide](Quick Start Guide)

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 you should just execute:

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
      # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade](oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade)

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.5. Please read [oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade](oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade) before starting the upgrade.
On CentOS and RHEL: For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

      [ovirt-32]
      name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
`baseurl=`[`http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/`](http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/)
      enabled=1
      skip_if_unavailable=1
      gpgcheck=0

Then

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup

should install ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.
Then:

      # engine-upgrade

this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
      # engine-setup

will upgrade to latest 3.3.

## What's New in 3.3.5?

## Known issues

*   Host deployment may fail on EL6 system due to a recent tuned regression (, ). Please downgrade tuned to previous version while waiting for a new tuned package solving this issue.
