### Current status

*   Initial code base uploaded, initial test images [available](http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/node-base/beta/iso/), should be ready for oVirt 3.3 beta
*   Last updated: 2013-05-22

### Detailed Description

An offshoot of the [Universal Node Image](/develop/release-management/features/node/universal-image/) feature. This plugin can be used to convert a generic oVirt Node image into an image ready for use with oVirt Engine.

### Benefit to oVirt

Because of the [Universal Node Image](/develop/release-management/features/node/universal-image/) feature, there would be no more oVirt Node image available with the oVirt Project. This plugin is simply the moving of the logic for interacting with oVirt Engine from oVirt Node into a plugin.

### Dependencies / Related Features

*   [Universal Node Image](/develop/release-management/features/node/universal-image/)

    -   ovirt-node
    -   ovirt-node-iso

### Testing

Cover all methods for registering an oVirt Node to oVirt Engine
