# oVirt 4.1.1 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of 4.1.1
First Test Compose as
of February 09, 2017.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, and provides an awesome
KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3, CentOS Linux 7.3
(or similar).


This is pre-release software.
Please take a look at our [community page](/community/) to know how to
ask questions and interact with developers and users.
All issues or bugs should be reported via the [Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/).
The oVirt Project makes no guarantees as to its suitability or usefulness.
This pre-release should not to be used in production, and it is not feature complete.


To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases,
check out the [previous versions release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/).
For a general overview of oVirt, read [the Quick Start Guide](Quick_Start_Guide)
and the [about oVirt](about oVirt) page.

An updated documentation has been provided by our downstream
[Red Hat Virtualization](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization?version=4.0/)


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions


### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL


## TEST COMPOSE

In order to install this Test Compose you will need to enable pre-release repository.


In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41-pre.rpm)


To test this pre release, you may read our
[Quick Start Guide](Quick Start Guide)

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install)
guide or the corresponding Red Hat Virtualization
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/paged/self-hosted-engine-guide/)

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine)
guide or the corresponding Red Hat Virtualization
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade-guide/upgrade-guide/)

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the epel repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS OpsTools SIG repos, for other packages.

EPEL currently includes collectd 5.7.1, and the collectd package there includes
the write_http plugin.

OpsTools currently includes collectd 5.7.0, and the write_http plugin is
packaged separately.

ovirt-release does not use collectd from epel, so if you only use it, you
should be ok.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to not
include collectd. Either use `includepkgs` and add those you need, or use
`excludepkgs=collectd*`.
## What's New in 4.1.0 Async release?
On February 3rd 2017 the ovirt team issued an async release of ovirt-engine package including a fix for:

## What's New in 4.1.1?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

##### Team: Infra

 - [BZ 1412547](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1412547) <b>Allow negotiation of highest available TLS version for engine <-> VDSM communication</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Currently when engine tries to connect to VDSM, it tries to negotiate highest available version of TLS, but due to issues in the past we have a limitation to try TLSv1.0 as highest version and not try any higher version.<br><br>This fix removes the limit, so we can negotiate also TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 when they will be available on VDSM side. Removing this limit will allow us to drop TLSv1.0 in future VDSM versions and provide only newer TLS versions<br>
