# Serial Execution of Asynchronous Tasks Detailed Design

## Summary

Currently, oVirt Engine has an ability to run an asynchronous task on the SPM. When the task completes, `AsyncTaskManager` re-creates the command and calls its `endAction()`, which is pivoted to `endSuccessfully()` or `endWithFailure()`, depending on the result of the SPM task. This feature aims to extend this behaviour to allow an engine command to fire a series of asynchronous SPM tasks in order to allow complex flows (e.g., Live Storage Migration, proper error handling in Move Disk) to be implemented.

## Owner

## Current status

*   Released in oVirt 3.1
*   Deprecated in oVirt 4.0, replaced by Command Coordination (CoCo)
*   Removed completely in oVirt 4.1

## Detailed Description

This feature will break the coupling where an engine command equals an SPM task. It will allow the engine to manage complicated asynchronous flows, possibly across several hosts.

### Entity Description

#### `SPMAsyncTask`

A new property, `executionIndex` (`int`) will be added, to signify the position of this task in a command's flow.

#### `SPMAsyncTaskHandler`

This new entity will represent how oVirt engine handles a single `SPMAsyncTask`, instead of how it's handled by `CommandBase` today. Its methods:

*   `beforeTask` - the execution carried out on the engine side before firing an async task. This is analogous the today's `executeAction()` body, and includes updating BEs and persisting them in the database.
*   `createTask` - how to create the async task
*   `endSuccessfully` - the code to run when a task ends successfully
*   `endWithFailure` - the code to run when a task ends unsuccessfully
*   `compensate` - the code to run if a completed task needs to be undone - see below.

#### `CommandBase`

`CommandBase` will hold a `List<SPMAsyncTaskHandler>` to manage executing of `SPMAsyncTasks`. Basically, `execute()` will iterate over the handlers and execute each. See details below.

#### `EntireCommandSPMAsyncTaskHandler`

This is a dummy class to mimic the old behavior of command base under the new design. It holds a reference to the wrapping `CommandBase` object and implementa `SPMAsyncTaskHandler` as follows:

*   `beforeTask` - calls `CommandBase.executeAction()`
*   `createTask` - returns `null` - is handled in the `beforeTask()`
*   `endSuccessfully` - calls `CommandBase.endSuccessfully()`
*   `endWithFailure` - calls `CommandBase.endWithFailure()`
*   `compensate` - empty, implemented in `endWithFailure()`

### CRUD

`SPMAsyncTask`'s CRUD operations should consider the new property. Other objects do not have interesting CRUD operations.

### User work-flows

#### Successful Execution

Instead of calling `executeCommand()`, `CommandBase` will iterate over its `SPMAsyncTaskHandlers` and execute them. The default `EntireCommandSPMAsyncTaskHandler` will simply call the command's `executeAction()` for backwards compatibility. For each one, `CommandBase` calls `beforeTask()`, and then fires an SPM command according to `createTask()`. When the command ends, `AsyncTaskManager` wakes up the handler, and it runs `endSuccessfully()`. `CommandBase` then starts the process over again with the next handler.

Note: the treatment of HSM commands remains synchronous, as has no bearing on this proposed feature's design.

#### Unsuccessful Execution

See the execution flow above. When an SPM task fails, the relevant handler is awoken, and it calls `endWithFailure()`. `CommandBase` then iterates in a *reverse* order, and calls each handler's `compensate()`.

### Events

#### JBoss Restart/Crash

When JBoss starts, task polling is restarted (as before this change). The only change is that now tasks are now persisted with their `executionIndex`, so when a tasks completes the command issuing it can be resumed from the correct place.

## Dependencies / Related Features and Projects

Live Storage Migration depends on this feature. This feature will also allow for better error handling in various Move Disk scenarios.
