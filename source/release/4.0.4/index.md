# oVirt 4.0.4 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 4.0.4
Release as of September 26th, 2016.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, and provides an awesome
KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2, CentOS Linux 7.2 (or similar).

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases,
check out the [previous versions release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/).

An updated documentation has been provided by our downstream 
[Red Hat Virtualization](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization?version=4.0/)


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

Users upgrading from 3.6 should be aware of following 4.0 changes around
authentication and certificates handling:

1. Single Sign-On using OAUTH2 protocol has been implemented in engine to
   allow SSO between webadmin, userportal and RESTAPI. More information can
   be found at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1092744

2. Due to SSO it's required to access engine only using the same FQDN which
   was specified during engine-setup invocation. If your engine FQDN is not
   accessible from all engine clients, you will not be able to login. Please
   use ovirt-engine-rename tool to fix your FQDN, more information can be
   found at https://www.ovirt.org/documentation/how-to/networking/changing-engine-hostname/ .
   If you try to access engine using IP or DNS alias, an error will be
   thrown. Please consult following bugs targeted to oVirt 4.0.4 which
   should fix this limitation:
     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1325746
     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1362196

3. If you have used Kerberos SSO to access engine, please consult
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1342192 how to update your Apache
   configuration after upgrade to 4.0

4. If you are using HTTPS certificate signed by custom certificate
   authority, please take a look at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1336838
   for steps which need to be done after migration to 4.0. Also please
   consult https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1313379 how to setup this custom
   CA for use with virt-viewer clients.



### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm)

and then follow documentation from our downstream
[Red Hat Virtualization](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/)

If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
      # engine-setup

Upgrade on Fedora 22 and Enterprise Linux 6 is not supported and you should follow our [Migration Guide](../../documentation/migration-engine-36-to-40/) in order to migrate to Enterprise Linux 7 or Fedora 23.

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install) guide or the
corresponding Red Hat Virtualization [Self Hosted Engine Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/paged/self-hosted-engine-guide/)

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine) guide
or the corresponding Red Hat Virtualization [Upgrade Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/paged/upgrade-guide/)

## Known issues

 - [BZ 1297835](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1297835) <b>Host install fails on Fedora 23 due to lack of dep on python2-dnf</b><br>On Fedora >= 23 dnf package manager with python 3 is used by default while
ovirt-host-deploy is executed by ovirt-engine using python2. This cause Host install to fail on Fedora >= 23 due to lack of python2-dnf in the default environment. As workaround please install manually python2-dnf on the host before trying to add it to the engine.


## What's New in 4.0.4?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

##### Team: Infra

 - [BZ 1344020](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1344020) <b>host upgrade should upgrade all oVirt related packages, not just "vdsm"</b><br>Previously, the host upgrade manager in the Administration Portal only checked and applied updates for the vdsm and vdsm-cli packages. Other packages had to be updated manually using "yum update". With this release, the list of packages that the host upgrade manager checks and updates has been extended to include ioprocess, mom, libvirt-client, libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter, libvirt-daemon-kvm, libvirt-lock-sanlock, libvirt-python, lvm2, ovirt-imageio-common, ovirt-imageio-daemon, ovirt-vmconsole, ovirt-vmconsole-host, python-ioprocess, qemu-kvm, qemu-img, sanlock, along with vdsm and vdsm-cli.

##### Team: Virt

 - [BZ 1302657](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1302657) <b>[RFE] Switch from vnc/cirrus to vnc/vga</b><br>With this update, the default VNC graphics in Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 is VGA. Imported virtual machines with VNC/Cirrus, and originating in previous compatibility versions, are automatically upgraded to VNC/VGA. However, QXL is still the preferred default graphics, if the guest operating system supports it.

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

##### Team: Integration

 - [BZ 1333449](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1333449) <b>RFE: Remove virt-viewer dependency in favor of text only method</b><br>Change --console option to provide access to serial console instead of calling virt-viewer.
 - [BZ 1368604](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1368604) <b>HE_APPLIANCE_ENGINE_SETUP_FAIL - Setup found legacy kerberos/ldap directory intergration</b><br>oVirt 4.0 doesn't support anymore the legacy directory integration. Adding a check for it in the upgrade procedure since the migration to the new aaa provider could to be performed only while on 3.6

#### MOM

##### Team: SLA

 - [BZ 1201482](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1201482) <b>Storage QoS is not applying on a Live VM/disk</b><br>To properly support disk hot plug and disk QoS changes for a running virtual machine, MoM is updated and now reads the IO QoS settings from metadata and sets the respective ioTune limits to a running virtual machine's disk.
