# How to write patches for DWH

## Install Talend DI and import the project

*   Download and install the latest Talend DI version.

      Available from: `[`http://www.talend.com/download.php`](http://www.talend.com/download.php)` 

*   Import the oVirt DWH project from the path:

      < repository folder path >/ovirt-dwh/tos_project

*   You may now edit the project using the studio.
*   Setup connections context in the Talend DI for the ovirt_engine_history database.

For details on this refer to Talend's documentation.

*   You may now run the project and test it in the Talend DI.

## If a change to the engine views is required

Follow the following steps:

*   Have a cloned ovirt-engine git repository
*   Setup a postgreSQL "engine" DB.
*   Make the necessary changes in:

        ./ovirt-engine/packaging/dbscripts/create_dwh_views.sql

## If a change to the "ovirt_engine_history" DB is required

Follow the following steps:

*   Have a cloned ovirt-dwh git repository
*   Setup a postgreSQL "ovirt_engine_history" DB.
*   Create an upgrade sql file in the following folder:

         ./ovirt-dwh/packaging/dbscripts/upgrade/

When needed, update the new column values before removing a related column.

*   Test to verify the expected results

Please not the following :

*   Upgrade runs are written to "schema_version" table.

In order to rerun an upgrade file, please remove from the "schema_version" table the corresponding line

and change for the previous line the "current" column to TRUE.

## If a change to the history views is required

Follow the following steps:

*   Have a cloned ovirt-engine git repository
*   Setup a postgreSQL "engine" DB.
*   Make the necessary changes for the latest views:

        ./ovirt-dwh/packaging/dbscripts/create_views_X_Y.sql

### Maintain Legacy views - Make the necessary changes to former views

*   If a column that existed in former versions was **removed** or its **type was changed**,

It is **mandatory** to make the change to former views so the API will not brake.

*   -   If Removed , add the column as Null value casted to the column type
    -   If the type of the column changed, make sure to cast the column to the previous type.

## Update ETL process in Talend Open Studio

*   Have the Talend open Studio installed in the project version.
*   Update the Jobs with the required changes.
*   Close all open jobs.

First,

*   Build the Job from the "History ETL" job.

*   -   Open the zip file and copy the java files from:

       ./HistoryETL/src/ovirt_engine_dwh

To the git repository :

       ./ovirt-dwh/etl_export/src/ovirt_engine_dwh

*   -   When changing the context - for example added a variable ,

copy the context from the zip file:

       ./HistoryETL/ovirt_engine_dwh/

To the git repository:

       ./ovirt-dwh/etl_export/ovirt_engine_dwh

*   -   When upgrading a Talend version, copy the routines from the zip file:

       ./HistoryETL/src/routines/

To the git repository:

      ./ovirt-dwh/etl_export/src/routines

Second,

*   Export the project :

![](/images/wiki/ExportTalendProject.png)

*   Copy from the zip file to the git repository :

       ./ovirt-dwh/tos_project 

Important ! Copy only into the folders that already exist in the tos_project folder. Do not copy : Metadata, sqlPatterns and temp.
