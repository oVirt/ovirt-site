=== Attaching a Storage Domain to a Data Center

Once you have added a storage domain to {virt-product-fullname}, you must attach it to a data center and activate it before it will be ready for use.

.Attaching a storage domain to a data center
====
This example attaches an existing NFS storage domain, `mydata`, to the an existing data center, `Default`. The attach action is facilitated by the `add` method of the data center's `storagedomains` collection. These examples may be used to attach both data and ISO storage domains.

import ovirtsdk4 as sdk
import ovirtsdk4.types as types

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = sdk.Connection(
    url='https://engine.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='password',
    ca_file='ca.pem',
)

# Locate the service that manages the storage domains and use it to
# search for the storage domain:
sds_service = connection.system_service().storage_domains_service()
sd = sds_service.list(search='name=mydata')[0]

# Locate the service that manages the data centers and use it to
# search for the data center:
dcs_service = connection.system_service().data_centers_service()
dc = dcs_service.list(search='name=Default')[0]

# Locate the service that manages the data center where we want to
# attach the storage domain:
dc_service = dcs_service.data_center_service(dc.id)

# Locate the service that manages the storage domains that are attached
# to the data centers:
attached_sds_service = dc_service.storage_domains_service()

# Use the "add" method of service that manages the attached storage
# domains to attach it:
attached_sds_service.add(
    types.StorageDomain(
        id=sd.id,
    ),
)

# Wait until the storage domain is active:
attached_sd_service = attached_sds_service.storage_domain_service(sd.id)
while True:
    time.sleep(5)
    sd = attached_sd_service.get()
    if sd.status == types.StorageDomainStatus.ACTIVE:
        break

print("Attached data storage domain '%s' to data center '%s' (Status: %s)." %
  (sd.name(), dc.name(), sd.status.state()))

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()
----

If the calls to the `add` methods are successful, the examples output the following text:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Attached data storage domain 'data1' to data center 'Default' (Status: maintenance).
----

`Status: maintenance` indicates that the storage domains still need to be activated.
