Read [Becoming an Infrastructure team member](/develop/infra/becoming-an-infrastructure-team-member/) for details on joining this project.

Read [Infrastructure team assignments](/develop/infra/infrastructure-team-administrators/) for information about who has access to which parts of the oVirt infrastructure.

### Apprentices and journeyfolk

If you wish to become part of the infra team and help maintain oVirt's infrastrucutre and do some cool DevOps tasks, feel free
to introduce yourself on infra@ovirt.org and we'll do the rest! 

## Type of tasks

As a devops team, our tasks varies and includes multiple possible ways of coding or maintaining the oVirt infra, some examples:

*   Writing puppet manifests
*   Writing yaml code via jenkins job builder to add new jobs
*   Installing a new service / server
*   Helping users on the list, usually with gerrit or jenkins issues
*   Helping to develop tools (we've got plenty!)

## How we work

This is a [community services infrastructure](http://fedorahosted.org/csi/) team. That means the project infrastructure is maintained to a [professional level](http://mmcgrath.fedorapeople.org/html-single/) by a group of system administrators who are contributing their time. (That time may be contributed as part of their job role, it might be part of a class or workshop, it might be purely voluntary, and so forth.)

People who come to work on this project are *not* already experts, but they might be. You are welcome to learn with us.

### Opening tickets to the Infra team

*   Email infra-support@ovirt.org, this will automatically open a ticket on our [Jira instance](https://ovirt-jira.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&projectKey=OVIRT). If you don't have a user, it will automatically send you a registration email and set you as a watcher on the ticket.

### Joining

*   To gain access to systems - think of them as keys to doors - we match your skill and the trust you have built with the project. This is part of being a [meritocracy](/community/about/governance/).

### Communication

The main thing is, come [communicate with us](#Communication) if you have any questions, are interested in learning more, or what to participate in supporting oVirt infrastructure.

*   [Mailing list infra@ovirt.org](https://lists.ovirt.org/archives/list/infra)@ovirt.org/
*   [IRC channel #ovirt on OFTC](irc://irc.oftc.net/#ovirt)

### Meetings

[Infrastructure Meetings](/develop/infra/infrastructure-team-meetings/)

### Decision process

* The Infra team generally follows the principle that if it didn't get discussed on the [mailing list](https://lists.ovirt.org/archives/list/infra),@ovirt.org/ it didn't really happen.
* This means all important or broad-reaching decisions are discussed and decided on the mailing list.
* The team uses the same [collaborative decision process](https://blogs.apache.org/comdev/entry/how_apache_projects_use_consensus) that other oVirt teams use, with some lightweight elements added to move along minor votes.
  * +1 is a vote in favor of a proposition 
  * -1 is a vote against a proposition, must be accompanied with an explanation of the negative vote.
  * +/-0 is an abstention
  * 3 or more +1 votes are required for anything substantial, important, or far-reaching
  * 0 or more votes will pass a minor proposition - "If no one objects, it passes."

## Our Architecture

TBD

### Documentation

Most of what we do is documented in our own RTD page. You can find the published docs at: <http://ovirt-infra-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>
