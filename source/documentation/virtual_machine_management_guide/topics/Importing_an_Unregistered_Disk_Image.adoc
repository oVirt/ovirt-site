==== Importing an Unregistered Disk Image from an Imported Storage Domain

You can import floating virtual disks from a storage domain. Floating disks created outside of a {virt-product-fullname} environment are not registered with the {engine-name}. Scan the storage domain to identify unregistered floating disks to be imported.

This procedure requires access to the Administration Portal.

[NOTE]
====
Only QEMU-compatible disks can be imported into the {engine-name}.
