= Copying host networks

To save time, you can copy a source host's network configuration to a target host in the same cluster.

Copying the network configuration includes:

* Logical networks attached to the host, except the `ovirtmgmt` management network
* Bonds attached to interfaces


.Limitations

* Do not copy network configurations that contain static IP addresses. Doing this sets the boot protocol in the target host to `none`.

* Copying a configuration to a target host with the same interface names as the source host but different physical network connections produces a wrong configuration.

* The target host must have an equal or greater number of interfaces than the source host. Otherwise, the operation fails.

* Copying `QoS`, `DNS`, and `custom_properties` is not supported.

* Network interface labels are not copied.

[WARNING]
====
Copying host networks replaces ALL network settings on the target host except its attachment to the `ovirtmgmt` management network.
====

.Prerequisites
* The number of NICs on the target host must be equal or greater than those on the source host. Otherwise, the operation fails.
* The hosts must be in the same cluster.

.Procedure

. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts].

. Select the source host whose configuration you want to copy.

. Click btn:[Copy Host Networks]. This opens the *Copy Host Networks* window.

. Use *Target Host* to select the host that should receive the configuration. The list only shows hosts that are in the same cluster.

. Click btn:[Copy Host Networks].

. Verify the network settings of the target host


.Tips

* Selecting multiple hosts disables the btn:[Copy Host Networks] button and context menu.
* Instead of using the btn:[Copy Host Networks] button, you can right-click a host and select menu:Copy Host Networks[] from the context menu.
* The btn:[Copy Host Networks] button is also available in any host's details view.
