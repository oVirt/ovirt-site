# oVirt engine tools

Engine tools are mainly standalone java programs wrapped-up by scripts and mostly using the engine libraries

## Tools list

1.  engine-manage-domains
2.  engine-config
3.  engine-notifier
4.  ovirt-log-collector
5.  generate-ssh-keys
6.  store-utils.sh

### Tools description

### engine-manage-domains

### ovirt-log-collector

Please refer to [The Log Collector Tool](/documentation/administration_guide/#sect-The_Log_Collector_Tool)
documentation within [oVirt Administration Guide](/documentation/administration_guide/)

### Tools TODO

1.  Standardize the usage of all tools and make them consistent
2.  Create common infrastructure both for Java programs and for the wrapping scripts e.g. functions to fulfill classpath dependencies, etc.
3.  Use comon paths for all
4.  Use a single logger library (apache-commons-logging)
