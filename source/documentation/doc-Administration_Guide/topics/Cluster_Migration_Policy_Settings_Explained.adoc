==== Migration Policy Settings Explained

A migration policy defines the conditions for live migrating virtual machines in the event of host failure. These conditions include the downtime of the virtual machine during migration, network bandwidth, and how the virtual machines are prioritized.

.Migration Policies Explained
[options="header"]
|===
|Policy |Description
|*Cluster default (Minimal downtime)*
|Overrides in `vdsm.conf` are still applied. The guest agent hook mechanism is disabled.
|*Minimal downtime* |A policy that lets virtual machines migrate in typical situations. Virtual machines should not experience any significant downtime. The migration will be aborted if the virtual machine migration does not converge after a long time (dependent on QEMU iterations, with a maximum of 500 milliseconds). The guest agent hook mechanism is enabled.
|*Post-copy migration* a|When used, post-copy migration pauses the migrating virtual machine vCPUs on the source host, transfers only a minimum of memory pages, activates the virtual machine vCPUs on the destination host, and transfers the remaining memory pages while the virtual machine is running on the destination.

The post-copy policy first tries pre-copy to verify whether convergence can occur. The migration switches to post-copy if the virtual machine migration does not converge after a long time.

This significantly reduces the downtime of the migrated virtual machine, and also guarantees that the migration finishes regardless of how rapidly the memory pages of the source virtual machine change. It is optimal for migrating virtual machines in heavy continuous use, which would not be possible to migrate with standard pre-copy migration.

The disadvantage of this policy is that in the post-copy phase, the virtual machine may slow down significantly as the missing parts of memory are transferred between the hosts.

[WARNING]
====
If the network connection breaks prior to the completion of the post-copy process, the {engine-name} pauses and then kills the running virtual machine. Do not use post-copy migration if the virtual machine availability is critical or if the migration network is unstable.
====

|*Suspend workload if needed* |A policy that lets virtual machines migrate in most situations, including virtual machines running heavy workloads. Because of this, virtual machines may experience a more significant downtime than with some of the other settings. The migration may still be aborted for extreme workloads. The guest agent hook mechanism is enabled.

The bandwidth settings define the maximum bandwidth of both outgoing and incoming migrations per host.

.Bandwidth Explained
[options="header"]
|===
|Policy |Description
|*Auto* |Bandwidth is copied from the *Rate Limit [Mbps]* setting in the data center *Host Network QoS*. If the rate limit has not been defined, it is computed as a minimum of link speeds of sending and receiving network interfaces. If rate limit has not been set, and link speeds are not available,  it is determined by local VDSM setting on sending host.
|*Hypervisor default* |Bandwidth is controlled by local VDSM setting on sending Host.
|*Custom* |Defined by user (in Mbps). This value is divided by the number of concurrent migrations (default is 2, to account for ingoing and outgoing migration). Therefore, the user-defined bandwidth must be large enough to accommodate all concurrent migrations.

For example, if the `Custom` bandwidth is defined as 600 Mbps, a virtual machine migration's maximum bandwidth is actually 300 Mbps.

The resilience policy defines how the virtual machines are prioritized in the migration.

|Field |Description/Action
|*Migrate Virtual Machines* |Migrates all virtual machines in order of their defined priority.
|*Migrate only Highly Available Virtual Machines* |Migrates only highly available virtual machines to prevent overloading other hosts.
|*Do Not Migrate Virtual Machines* |Prevents virtual machines from being migrated.
