# Promote oVirt

Basically any and all mentions of oVirt is a good thing to build the awareness for the project.
This can take the form of press, blogs, twitter, meetups, workshops or even sessions or speaking slots that any in the community gets to speak about oVirt.

This pages have been created to help the oVirt community to be more effective in promoting itself.

## If you speak anywhere about oVirt

If you speak at a meetup, conference, or anywhere about oVirt email the users@ovirt.org and board@ovirt.org lists with the follow basic info

*   Time and place
*   Who is speaking
*   link to press (if applicable)

And then everyone can help plug it for you.
Additionally if there are more than one of us at the event then we can meet up and coordinate.

Sample things you can help with are:

## Roster of meetups/workshops that oVirt would like to attend

The follow section is to help plan oVirt workshops and meetups.
