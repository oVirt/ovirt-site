# Appendix C: Enabling Gluster Processes on Gluster Storage Nodes

1. Click **Compute** &rarr; **Clusters**.

2. Click **New**.

3. Click the **General** tab and select the **Enable Gluster Service** check box. Enter the address, SSH fingerprint, and password as necessary. The address and password fields can be filled in only when the **Import existing Gluster configuration** check box is selected.

4. Click **OK**.

It is now possible to add Gluster Storage nodes to the Gluster cluster, and to mount Gluster volumes as storage domains. `iptables` rules no longer block storage domains from being added to the cluster.
