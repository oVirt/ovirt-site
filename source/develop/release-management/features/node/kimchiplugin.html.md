### Current status

*   Development 0% complete
*   Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page
*   Last updated: ,

### Detailed Description

Kimchi is a HTML5 interface to KVM designed to make managing KVM easy without libvirt. Currently, oVirt Node images must be registered to an engine in order to provision VMs, but libvirt is functional without using VDSM as an intermediary. A Kimchi plugin would allow for Node images to manage their virtual machines directly.

### Benefit to oVirt

Essentially feature parity with XenServer and ESXi in providing a way to manage VMs on a single node with no external dependencies.
