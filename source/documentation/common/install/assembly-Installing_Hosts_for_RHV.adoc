= Installing Hosts for {virt-product-fullname}

{virt-product-fullname} supports two types of hosts: xref:Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_{context}[{hypervisor-fullname}s ({hypervisor-shortname})] and xref:Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_hosts_{context}[{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s]. Depending on your environment, you may want to use one type only, or both. At least two hosts are required for features such as migration and high availability.

See xref:Recommended_practices_for_configuring_host_networks_{context}[] for networking information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
SELinux is in enforcing mode upon installation. To verify, run `getenforce`. SELinux must be in enforcing mode on all hosts and Managers for your {virt-product-fullname} environment to be supported.

.Host Compatibility

When you create a new data center, you can set the compatibility version. Select the compatibility version that suits all the hosts in the data center. Once set, version regression is not allowed. For a fresh {virt-product-fullname} installation, the latest compatibility version is set in the default data center and default cluster; to use an earlier compatibility version, you must create additional data centers and clusters. For more information about compatibility versions see _{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} Compatibility_ in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhev[{virt-product-fullname} Life Cycle].
