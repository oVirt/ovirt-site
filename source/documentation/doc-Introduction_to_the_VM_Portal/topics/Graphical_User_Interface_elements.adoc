*Key graphical user interface elements*

.Header bar

The header bar contains the following buttons:

* btn:[Refresh] - manually refreshes the display. See also Refresh Interval.
* btn:[Account Settings] -  enables setting of logged-in user preferences that are persisted on the server.
** btn:[Reset settings] - allows you to reset all options back to initial installation defaults.
** General - displays the user name, email address, and allows you to change the UI language.
+
[NOTE]
====
Changing the language setting will override the language chosen in a landing page or by a URL query. See also Advanced Options.
====

** Refresh Interval - set the automatic UI refresh rate interval.
** Notifications - allows you to mute all notifications for a given time interval. This option is not server persisted, so a page reload will clear this settings.
** Console - settings are applied globally for all VMs.
*** Select your preferred console. This will be the first console option  displayed in the VM card (VNC console,  VNC console (Browser),  SPICE console, Remote desktop).
*** Connect automatically - automatic console login option. Enables automatically connecting to the VM's console of the chosen VM after the user logs in to the VM Portal.
+
[NOTE]
====
Log in is detected based on the age of the session. The default is 60 seconds, and can be changed using the `sessionAgeFirstLoginThresholdInSeconds` parameter in the `ovirt-web-ui.config` file. Setting this parameter to zero disables log in detection, and a console connection will be made on every page reload.
====
*** VNC Options
*** VNC (Browser) Options
*** SPICE Options
*** Serial Console Options - SSH Key for authentication.
** Advanced Options - enable language settings to persist on the server. Enable the the chosen language/URL query language parameter on the landing page to override the chosen user settings language after each login. This enables compatibility with previous language settings behavior.
* btn:[User] - displays the user name of the currently logged in user.
** About - VM Portal version information.
** Log out - to log out of the VM Portal.
* btn:[Notifications] - displays notifications.
