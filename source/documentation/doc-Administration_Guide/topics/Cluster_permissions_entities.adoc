|===
|Role |Privileges |Notes
|ClusterAdmin |Cluster Administrator |Can use, create, delete, manage all physical and virtual resources in a specific cluster, including hosts, templates and virtual machines. Can configure network properties within the cluster such as designating display networks, or marking a network as required or non-required.

However, a *ClusterAdmin* does not have permissions to attach or detach networks from a cluster, to do so *NetworkAdmin* permissions are required.
|NetworkAdmin |Network Administrator |Can configure and manage the network of a particular cluster. A network administrator of a cluster inherits network permissions for virtual machines within the cluster as well.
