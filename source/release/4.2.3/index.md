# oVirt 4.2.3 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.3 release as of May 04, 2018.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5,
CentOS Linux 7.5 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.3, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## CVE-2018-3639 - Important - oVirt - Speculative Store Bypass

As you may have already heard, an industry-wide issue was found in the way
many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution
of Load & Store instructions.
This issue is well described by CVE-2018-3639 announce available at
[https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-3639](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-3639).

oVirt team has released on May 23th an update of ovirt-engine to version
4.2.3.7 which add support for SSBD CPUs in order to mitigate the security
issue.

If you are running oVirt on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please apply updates
described in [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-3639](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-3639).

If you are running oVirt on CentOS Linux please apply updated described by:
- [CESA-2018:1629 Important CentOS 7 kernel Security Update](https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2018-May/022843.html)
- [CESA-2018:1632 Important CentOS 7 libvirt Security Update](https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2018-May/022840.html)
- [CESA-2018:1649 Important CentOS 7 java-1.8.0-openjdk Security Update](https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2018-May/022839.html)
- [CESA-2018:1648 Important CentOS 7 java-1.7.0-openjdk Security Update](https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2018-May/022838.html)

An update for qemu-kvm-ev has been also tagged for release and announced
with [CESA-2018:1655 Important: qemu-kvm-ev security update](https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-virt/2018-May/005804.html)

If you're running oVirt on a different Linux distribution, please check
with your vendor for available updates.

Please note that to fully mitigate this vulnerability, system
administrators must apply both hardware “microcode” updates and software
patches that enable new functionality.
At this time, microprocessor microcode will be delivered by the individual
manufacturers.

The oVirt team recommends end users and systems administrator to apply any
available updates as soon as practical.


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### No Fedora support

Regretfully, Fedora is not supported anymore, and RPMs for it are not provided.
These are still built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
At this point, we only try to fix problems specific to Fedora if they affect
developers. For some of the work to be done to restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## What's New in 4.2.3?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1550135](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1550135) <b>Failed logging attempts are not audited / logged</b><br>Failed login attempts now appear in the audit log, with details and the user name that failed to log in.
 - [BZ 1540955](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1540955) <b>The Affinity Positive/Negative Value is not updated in the UI window</b><br>The host to VM affinity can now be explicitly disabled, as described in Bug 1493149.<br><br>This change adds 4 new columns to the affinity group table in the UI:<br>- 'vm polarity' - Shows if the VM affinity is positive, negative or disabled<br>- 'vm enforcing' - Shows if the VM affinity is enforcing or not<br>- 'host polarity' - Shows if the VM to host affinity is positive, negative or disabled<br>- 'host enforcing' - Shows if the VM to host affinity is enforcing or not
 - [BZ 1555268](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1555268) <b>[RFE] Kernel address space layout randomization [KASLR] support</b><br>Previously, Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernels had kernel address space layout randomization enabled by default. This feature prevented trouble-shooting and analysis of the guest's memory dumps. In the current feature, "vmcoreinfo" is enabled for all Linux guests. It allows a compatible kernel to export the debugging information so that the memory image can be analyzed.
 - [BZ 1554111](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1554111) <b>[RFE] - Report MTU on iface</b><br>Please extend the LLDP note in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2-beta/html-single/administration_guide/#Editing_host_network_interfaces<br>to refer to the new bit of data. It is recommended to check that the MTU of the logical network is less or equal to that supported by peer switches.
 - [BZ 1552026](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1552026) <b>The api does not return the OS architecture</b><br>Operation Systems Information returned by REST API now contains the OS architecture.
 - [BZ 1566366](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1566366) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.4] [RFE] [RHV] Add support to query illegal images in unlock_entity.sh</b><br>
 - [BZ 1540973](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1540973) <b>hosts rule in affinity group is always enabled in rest response API (even if disabled in UI )</b><br>Feature: <br>The host to VM affinity can now be explicitly disabled. Previously it was always enabled, but it had no effect if no hosts were assigned to the affinity group.<br><br>Reason: <br>Having the affinity always enabled could be confusing when using the REST API.
 - [BZ 1565099](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1565099) <b>Bump required Ansible version to 2.5</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Ansible 2.5 is now required for engine and all Ansible roles distributed with oVirt engine<br><br>Reason: <br><br>Result:

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1551350](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1551350) <b>[RFE] Add support for querying information from QEMU Guest Agent</b><br>It is now possible to obtain infomation like hostname, OS info, time zone and active users on VMs where ovirt-guest-agent is not installed and only QEMU Guest Agent is present.
 - [BZ 1334982](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1334982) <b>[RFE] Gracefully shutdown Virtual Machines on Host reboot/shutdown.</b><br>Previously, in an emergency, users were required to shut down the hosts to preserve the data center. This caused running virtual machines to be killed by the systemd process without performing a graceful shutdown. As a result, the virtual machines' state became undefined, which led to problematic scenarios for virtual machines running databases such as Oracle and SAP.<br><br>In this release, virtual machines can be gracefully shut down by delaying the systemd process. After the virtual machines are shut down, the systemd process takes control and continues the shutdown. The VDSM is only shut down after the virtual machines have been gracefully shut down, after passing information to the Manager and waiting 5 seconds for the Manager to acknowledge the virtual machines have been shut down.
 - [BZ 1447300](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1447300) <b>enable libguestfs tools on ppc64le</b><br>Sparsify and sysprep can now be run on POWER hosts.
 - [BZ 1550106](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1550106) <b>[RFE] IOProcess thread of storage domain should be correlated to the domain id/name</b><br>Feature: <br>Log IOProcessClient's name<br><br>Reason: <br>Before this patch, IOProcessesClient name used a counter (e.g. "ioprocess-0") and it was impossible to correlate ioprocess to the storage domain.<br><br>Result:<br>This patch changes the client name in IOProcessClient to one of the following (as described in the patch):<br>- "Global"<br>- "domain-uuid"<br>- "/[GlusterSD/]server:_path"

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1538934](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1538934) <b>[RFE] hosted-engine --vm-status should provide a way to detect and warn about failed deployments</b><br>hosted-engine --vm-status should warn the user about past failed or still in progress deployment attempts.

#### oVirt Engine Metrics

 - [BZ 1563681](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1563681) <b>Add OpenShift 3.9 ansible inventory file and copy in to metrics store machine</b><br>Feature: <br>To make OpenShift installation easier, we generate the inventory files and vars.yml file and copy them to the metrics store machine.<br> <br>Reason: <br>To make OpenShift installation easier<br><br>Result: <br>The user does not need to handle the inventory and vars.yml file and can use them when running the OpenShift ansible playbooks.
 - [BZ 1560240](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1560240) <b>OpenShift Logging should use the partition supplied by the user for elasticsearch persistent storage</b><br>In this release, it is possible to configure a persistent storage partition other than the default partition (/var) for Elasticsearch, by setting a parameter in the OpenShift Ansible inventory files.

#### cockpit-ovirt

 - [BZ 1547464](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1547464) <b>[RFE]Tick mark on one check box  in brick configuration should check mark  all the bricks under that device.</b><br>
