=== Shareable Disks in {virt-product-fullname}

Some applications require storage to be shared between servers. {virt-product-fullname} allows you to mark virtual machine hard disks as *Shareable* and attach those disks to virtual machines. That way a single virtual disk can be used by multiple cluster-aware guests.

Shared disks are not to be used in every situation. For applications like clustered database servers, and other highly available services, shared disks are appropriate. Attaching a shared disk to multiple guests that are not cluster-aware is likely to cause data corruption because their reads and writes to the disk are not coordinated.

You cannot take a snapshot of a shared disk. Virtual disks that have snapshots taken of them cannot later be marked shareable.

You can mark a disk shareable either when you create it, or by editing the disk later.
