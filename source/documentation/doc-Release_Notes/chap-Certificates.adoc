[role="_abstract"]
{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} uses certificates to enable encrypted communications. These {virt-product-shortname} certificates follow a standard 398 day lifetime and *must* be renewed once per year.

[WARNING]
====
Do not let certificates expire. If they expire, the environment becomes non-responsive and recovery is an error-prone and time-consuming process.
====

Starting in {virt-product-shortname} {vername_rhv}, you will receive warning notifications 120 days before expiration and error notifications 30 days before expiration. Do not ignore these notifications. For information on renewing certificates, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#chap-Renewing_certificates_RHV_backup_restore[Renewing certificates before they expire] in the _Administration Guide_.
