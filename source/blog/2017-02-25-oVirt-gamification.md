## What is Gamification?
Gamification is the concept of applying game mechanics and game design techniques to engage and motivate people to achieve their goals.[1] 
It taps into the basic desires and needs of the users impulses which revolve around the idea of Status and Achievement.

To put it in other words, it is turning day-to-day tasks, the kind you might do at home or work, into a game which you can
earn points, badgets and compete with other people that are doing the same things.  

## oVirt & Gamification
You probably didn't know, but this isn't the first time oVirt gamification is being used.
A few years ago there was an initiative to use oVirt UI plugins system to add Gamification to the project, 
there was even a 'space invaders' game written and available to play inside oVirt! checkout more info at [2].

### So What is New?
The oVirt infra team recently reached out to 'GetBadges', a company which provides 'Gamifcation as a Service'.
Luckly for us, open source projects gets to have a free game! So oVirt was rewarded with its own [oVirt Open Source Game](https://ovirt-ovirt-engine.getbadges.io/activity)
The game works automagically every time you contribute to the project, current activated integrations are [3]: 
 * GitHub  - any commit merged rewards points 
 * Jenkins - any successful build rewards points and failed builds deduct points 
 * Jira    - any new ticket opened or closed in jira.ovirt.org rewards points

Other than points, you are rewarded with cool badges every time you acomplish an achievement, like triggeing a first successful build.
