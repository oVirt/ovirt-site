= Activating a Storage Domain

Once you have added a storage domain to {virt-product-fullname} and attached it to a data center, you must activate it before it will be ready for use.

.Activating a storage domain
====
This example activates an NFS storage domain, `mydata`, attached to the data center, `Default`. The `activate` action is facilitated by the `activate` method of the storage domain.

# Locate the service that manages the storage domains and use it to
# search for the storage domain:
sds_service = connection.system_service().storage_domains_service()
sd = sds_service.list(search='name=mydata')[0]

# Locate the service that manages the data centers and use it to
# search for the data center:
dcs_service = connection.system_service().data_centers_service()
dc = dcs_service.list(search='name=Default')[0]

# Locate the service that manages the data center where we want to
# attach the storage domain:
dc_service = dcs_service.data_center_service(dc.id)

# Locate the service that manages the storage domains that are attached
# to the data centers:
attached_sds_service = dc_service.storage_domains_service()

# Activate storage domain:
attached_sd_service = attached_sds_service.storage_domain_service(sd.id)
attached_sd_service.activate()

# Wait until the storage domain is active:
while True:
    time.sleep(5)
    sd = attached_sd_service.get()
    if sd.status == types.StorageDomainStatus.ACTIVE:
        break

print("Attached data storage domain '%s' to data center '%s' (Status: %s)." %
  (sd.name(), dc.name(), sd.status.state()))

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()

If the `activate` requests are successful, the examples output the text:

[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
Activated storage domain 'mydata' in data center 'Default' (Status: active).
----

`Status: active` indicates that the storage domains have been activated.
