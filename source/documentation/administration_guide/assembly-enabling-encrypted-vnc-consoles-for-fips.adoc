= Enabling encrypted VNC consoles for FIPS
:context: encrypted-vnc

You can set up encrypted VNC consoles to work with a {virt-product-fullname} ({virt-product-shortname}) {engine-name} and hosts that have FIPS enabled.

To set up encrypted VNC consoles, you complete the following procedures:

* xref:enabling-fips_in_rhv[Enable FIPS in RHV]
// * Creating RHV hosts that have FIPS enabled, or enabling FIPS on existing hosts.
// * Enabling FIPS using the RHV Manager, including:
// ** Configuring the hosts to support FIPS mode.
* xref:configuring_cluster_to_enable_vnc_encryption[Configure the host cluster's console settings to enable VNC Encryption].

* xref:configuring_remote_viewer_trust_rhvm_ca_certificate[Configure the Remote Viewer to trust the Manager's CA certificate.]

[id="configuring_cluster_to_enable_vnc_encryption"]
== Configuring the cluster to enable VNC Encryption

.Procedure

. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Clusters].

. Select the cluster where you plan to enable VNC encryption and click btn:[Edit]. The *Edit Cluster* window opens.

. Select the *Console* tab.

. Select the *Enable VNC Encryption* checkbox and click btn:[OK].

[id="running_vnc_sasl_ansible_playbook_for_each_host"]
== Running the VNC SASL Ansible playbook for each host

.Procedure

. In the Administration Portal, put the hosts you created with FIPS enabled into maintenance mode:
.. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts].
.. In the *Virtual Machines* column, verify that each host has zero virtual machines. Perform a live migration to remove all virtual machines from any hosts where necessary. For details, see link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#sect-Migrating_Virtual_Machines_Between_Hosts[Migrating Virtual Machines Between Hosts]
.. Select each host and click menu:Management[Maintenance] and btn:[OK].

. Connect to the command line of the machine where the Manager is running.
+
* If the Manager is running on a stand-alone machine, connect to that machine's command line. For example, enter:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# ssh root@rhvm
----

* If the Manager is running as a self-hosted engine, use menu:Compute[Virtual Machines] to select the self-hosted engine virtual machine, named `HostedEngine` by default, and click btn:[Console].

. On the Manager machine, run the VNC SASL ansible playbook for each host.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# cd /usr/share/ovirt-engine/ansible-runner-service-project/project/
# ansible-playbook --ask-pass --inventory=<hostname>, ovirt-vnc-sasl.yml
----
+
For `<hostname>`, enter the complete *Hostname* shown on menu:Compute[Hosts].

. Select the host and click menu:Installation[Reinstall].
. After reinstallation, select the host and click menu:Management[Restart].
. After rebooting, select the host and click menu:Management[Activate].

.Troubleshooting

When running the VNC SASL Ansible playbook, the task might fail with the following error message:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Using a SSH password instead of a key is not possible because Host Key checking is enabled and sshpass does not support this.  Please add this host's fingerprint to your known_hosts file to manage this host.
----

To solve this problem, disable host key checking by doing one of the following:

* Disable host key checking permanently by uncommenting the following line in [filename]`/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
#host_key_checking = False
----

* Disable host key checking temporarily by running the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False.
----

[id="configuring_remote_viewer_trust_rhvm_ca_certificate"]
== Configuring the Remote Viewer to trust the Manager's CA certificate

Configure the Remote Viewer console on your client machine, `virt-viewer` or `remote-viewer`, to trust the RHV Manager's certificate authority (CA)

.Procedure

. Navigate to `\https://<__engine_address__>/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&amp;format=X509-PEM-CA`.

. Enable all the trust settings.

. On the client machine where you plan to run the VNC console, create a directory for the certificate file:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
$ mkdir ~/.pki/CA
----
+
[WARNING]
====
If this step generates an error such as `mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/home/example_user/.pki/CA’: File exists`, take precautions to avoid overwriting `~/.pki/CA/cacert.pem` in the next step. For example, include the current date in the filename.
====
. Download the certificate:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
$ curl -k -o ~/.pki/CA/cacert-<today's date>.pem '\https://<engine_address>/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA'
----

. Install the certificate authority in your browser:
+
* link:{URL_customer-portal}solutions/95103[Firefox]
* link:{URL_customer-portal}solutions/17864[Internet Explorer]
* link:{URL_customer-portal}solutions/1168383[Google Chrome].

Install the SASL SCRAM libraries on the client machine:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
$ sudo dnf install cyrus-sasl-scram
----

.Verification steps

. Run a virtual machine on one of the FIPS-enabled hosts you created.

. Connect to the virtual machine using a VNC console.
