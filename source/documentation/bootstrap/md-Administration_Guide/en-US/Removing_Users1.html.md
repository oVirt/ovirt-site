# Removing Users

When a user account is no longer required, remove it from Red Hat Virtualization.

**Removing Users**

1. Click the **Users** tab to display the list of authorized users.

2. Select the user to be removed. Ensure the user is not running any virtual machines.

3. Click the **Remove** button. A message displays prompting you to confirm the removal. Click **OK**.

The user is removed from Red Hat Virtualization, but not from the external directory.
