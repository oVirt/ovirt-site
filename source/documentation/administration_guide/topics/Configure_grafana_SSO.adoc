.Configuring Grafana for Single Sign-on

The {engine-name} engine-setup automatically configures Grafana to allow existing users on the {engine-name} to log in with SSO from the Administration Portal, but does not automatically create users. You need to create new users (`Invite` in the Grafana UI), confirm the new user, and then they can log in.

. Set an email address for the user in the {engine-name}, if it is not already defined.
. Log in to Grafana with an existing admin user (the initially configured admin).
. Go to menu:Configuration[Users] and select btn:[Invite].
. Input the email address and name, and select a Role.
. Send the invitation using one of these options:
+
* Select btn:[Send invite mail] and click btn:[Submit]. For this option, you need an operational local mail server configured on the Grafana machine.
+
or
+
* Select btn:[Pending Invites]
** Locate the entry you want
** Select btn:[Copy invite]
** Copy and use this link to create the account by pasting it directly into a browser address bar, or by sending it to another user.

If you use the Pending Invites option, no email is sent, and the email address does not really need to exist - any valid looking address will work, as long as itâ€™s configured as the email address of a {engine-name} user.

.To log in with this account:

. Log in to the {virt-product-fullname} web administration welcome page using the account that has this email address.
. Select `Monitoring Portal` to open the Grafana dashboard.
. Select btn:[Sign in with oVirt Engine Auth].
