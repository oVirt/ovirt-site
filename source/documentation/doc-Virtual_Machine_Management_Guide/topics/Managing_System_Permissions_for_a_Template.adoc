==== Managing System Permissions for a Template

As the *SuperUser*, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a *DataCenterAdmin* role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a *ClusterAdmin* has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.

A template administrator is a system administration role for templates in a data center. This role can be applied to specific virtual machines, to a data center, or to the whole virtualized environment; this is useful to allow different users to manage certain virtual resources.

The template administrator role permits the following actions:

* Create, edit, export, and remove associated templates.

* Import and export templates.



[NOTE]
====
You can only assign roles and permissions to existing users.
