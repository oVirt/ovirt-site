# Recording video

This page will contain instructions on recording a screencast on Linux and Windows for oVirt demo screencasts. I found this article very informative and useful: [How I record demo videos](http://www.itauthor.com/2009/03/10/how-i-record-demo-videos/)

## GNOME 3

*   Hit Ctrl-Alt-Shift-R to start recording, hit again to stop recording
*   The video will be in /home/<user>/Videos/Screencast from <date>.webm

## GNOME 2 or KDE

*   Install recordmydesktop with the appropriate front-end for your desktop
*   <Add instructions on using recordmydesktop>

## Windows

*   <Add instructions on recording desktop on windows>

# Adding a soundtrack

## GNOME

*   Start GNOME Sound Recorder
*   Start playing the video recorded previously
*   Record your voice-over (use a microphone to get better sound quality)
*   Use Pitivi to synchronise sound and image, and to cut beginning and end bits out.
*   Save in a YouTube compatible format which is not patent encumbered such as .ogv or .webm

## Other desktops

*   <Add instructions for other desktop environments here>
