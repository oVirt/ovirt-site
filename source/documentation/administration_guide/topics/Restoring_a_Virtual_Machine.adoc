[[Restoring_a_Virtual_Machine]]
==== Restoring a Virtual Machine

Restore a virtual machine that has been backed up using the backup and restore API. This procedure assumes you have a backup virtual machine on which the software used to manage the previous backup is installed.

*Restoring a Virtual Machine*

. In the Administration Portal, create a floating disk on which to restore the backup. See xref:Creating_a_Virtual_Disk[] for details on how to create a floating disk.
. Attach the disk to the backup virtual machine:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
POST /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/disks/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml

<disk id="_{disk:id}_">
</disk>
----
+
NOTE: Here, replace `_{vm:id}_` with the ID of this _backup_ virtual machine, not the virtual machine whose snapshot you made earlier. Replace `_{disk:id}_` with the disk ID you got while backing up the virtual machine.

. Use the backup software to restore the backup to the disk.
. Detach the disk from the backup virtual machine:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
DELETE /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/disks/_{disk:id}_ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml

<action>
    <detach>true</detach>
</action>
----
+
+
NOTE: Here, replace `_{vm:id}_` with the ID of this _backup_ virtual machine, not the virtual machine whose snapshot you made earlier. Replace `_{disk:id}_` with the disk ID.

. Create a new virtual machine using the configuration data of the virtual machine being restored:
+
[options="nowrap" ]
----
POST /api/vms/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml

<vm>
    <cluster>
        <name>cluster_name</name>
    </cluster>
    <name>_NAME_</name>
      <initialization>
      <configuration>
  <data>
  <!-- omitting long ovf data -->
  </data>
      <type>ovf</type>
      </configuration>
      </initialization>
    ...
</vm>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To override any of the values in the ovf while creating the virtual machine,  redefine the element _before_ or _after_ the `initialization` element. Not within the initialization element.
====
+
. Attach the disk to the new virtual machine:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
POST /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/disks/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml

<disk id="_{disk:id}_">
</disk>
----
+
NOTE: Here, replace `_{vm:id}_` with the ID of the _new_ virtual machine, not the virtual machine whose snapshot you made earlier.  Replace `_{disk:id}_` with the disk ID.

You have restored a virtual machine using a backup that was created using the backup and restore API.
