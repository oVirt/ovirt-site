# Infrastructure

Here is the Infrastructure Team and what we work on for the [oVirt project](http://ovirt.org).

## Mission Statement

The oVirt Infra Team is a volunteer effort to provide community infrastructure services by following the tenets of open source and accepted professional standards of system administrators.

## How we work

This is a [community services infrastructure](http://fedorahosted.org/csi/) team. That means the project infrastructure is maintained to a [professional level](http://mmcgrath.fedorapeople.org/html-single/) by a group of system administrators who are contributing their time. (That time may be contributed as part of their job role, it might be part of a class or workshop, it might be purely voluntary, and so forth.)

People who come to work on this project are *not* already experts, but they might be. You are welcome to learn with us.

To gain access to systems - think of them as keys to doors - we match your skill and the trust you have built with the project. This is part of being a [meritocracy](http://www.ovirt.org/governance/).

As this small team defines process, content will be added to this page.

The main thing is, come [communicate with us](#Communicate) if you have any questions, are interested in learning more, or what to participate in supporting oVirt infrastructure.

## Communication

*   [Mailing list infra@ovirt.org](http://lists.ovirt.org/mailman/listinfo/infra)
*   [IRC channel #ovirt on OFTC](irc://irc.oftc.net/#ovirt)

### Decision process

The Infra team generally follows the principle that if it didn't get discussed on the mailing list, it didn't really happen.

This means all important or broad-reaching decisions are discussed and decided on the [mailing list](http://lists.ovirt.org/mailman/listinfo/infra).

The team uses the same [collaborative decision process](https://blogs.apache.org/comdev/entry/how_apache_projects_use_consensus) that other oVirt teams use, with some lightweight elements added to move along minor votes.

*   +1 is a vote in favor of a proposition
*   -1 is a vote against a proposition, must be accompanied with an explanation of the negative vote.
*   +/-0 is an abstention
*   3 or more +1 votes are required for anything substantial, important, or far-reaching
*   0 or more votes will pass a minor proposition - "If no one objects, it passes."
