[[Synchronizing_host_networks]]
==== Synchronizing Host Networks

The {engine-name} defines a network interface as  `out-of-sync` when the definition of the interface on the host differs from the definitions stored by the {engine-name}.
Out-of-sync networks appear with an Out-of-sync icon image:images/out-of-sync.png[] in the host's *Network Interfaces* tab and with this icon image:images/out-of-sync-setup.png[] in the *Setup Host Networks* window.

When a host's network is out of sync, the only activities that you can perform on the unsynchronized network in the *Setup Host Networks* window are detaching the logical network from the network interface or synchronizing the network.

.Understanding How a Host Becomes out-of-sync
A host will become out of sync if:

* You make configuration changes on the host rather than using the the *Edit Logical Networks* window, for example:
** Changing the VLAN identifier on the physical host.

** Changing the *Custom MTU* on the physical host.

* You move a host to a different data center with the same network name, but with different values/parameters.

* You change a network's *VM Network* property by manually removing the bridge from the host.

.Preventing Hosts from Becoming Unsynchronized
Following these best practices will prevent your host from becoming unsynchronized:

. Use the Administration Portal to make changes rather than making changes locally on the host.

. Edit VLAN settings according to the instructions in xref:Editing-VLAN-Settings[].

.Synchronizing Hosts
Synchronizing a host's network interface definitions involves using the definitions from the {engine-name} and applying them to the host. If these are not the definitions that you require, after synchronizing your hosts update their definitions from the Administration Portal.
You can synchronize a host's networks on three levels:

* Per logical network
* Per host
* Per cluster

.Synchronizing Host Networks on the Logical Network Level

. Click menu:Compute[Hosts].
. Click the host's name to open the details view.
. Click the *Network Interfaces* tab.
. Click *Setup Host Networks*.
. Hover your cursor over the unsynchronized network and click the pencil icon to open the *Edit Network* window.
. Select the *Sync network* check box.
. Click *OK* to save the network change.
. Click *OK* to close the *Setup Host Networks* window.

.Synchronizing a Host's Networks on the Host level

* Click the *Sync All Networks* button in the host's *Network Interfaces* tab to synchronize all of the host's unsynchronized network interfaces.

.Synchronizing a Host's Networks on the Cluster level
* Click the *Sync All Networks* button in the cluster's *Logical Networks* tab to synchronize all unsynchronized logical network definitions for the entire cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can also synchronize a host's networks via the REST API. See link:http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-engine-api-model/4.4#services-host-methods-sync_all_networks[syncallnetworks] in the _REST API Guide_.
