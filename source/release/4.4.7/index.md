## Known issues

### Workaround for: upgrade of oVirt Node to 4.4.7 from previous version breaks VM migration

It has been reported that upgrading to oVirt Node 4.4.7 breaks VM migration due to SELinux denials.
For all the details please read **[[Bug 1979624]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1979624) - imgbase should not copy selinux binary policy file**.
To workaround this, on each oVirt Node upgrade from previous versions please run as root:
```bash
semodule -B
touch /.autorelabel
reboot
```

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.7 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.7 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.7).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.7?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine WildFly

 - [BZ 1938101](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1938101) **Rebase on Wildfly 23**

   oVirt Engine now requires WildFly 23


#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1966574](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1966574) **Update the required Grafana to 7.3 in ovirt-dwh**

   Required Grafana version changed from 6.7 to 7.3.


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1901011](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1901011) **[RFE] Remove Foreman integration from engine**

   Foreman integration, which allow to provision bare metal hosts from webadmin using Foreman and afterwards being added to engine, hasn't been properly maintained for quite some time due to resource limitation and as there was no significant feedback from users about this feature, it was deprecated in oVirt 4.4.6 and now removed completely in oVirt 4.4.7.



Similar functionality to provision bare metal host can be achieved using Foreman directly and after that just add already provisioned host using webadmin or RESTAPI.

 - [BZ 1804774](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1804774) **Simplify the process to add a msg on the RHVM Admin Portal Login**

   Adding a message to the welcome page is straight forward using a custom branding only containing a preamble section. An example of a preamble branding is https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1783329.



On an engine upgrade the custom preamble brand will remain in place and will work without issue.



During an engine backup and subsequent restore, on engine restore it is expected that the custom preamble branding will need to be manually restored/reinstalled and verified.

 - [BZ 1950343](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1950343) **[RFE] Set compatibility level 4.6 for Default DataCenter/Cluster during new installations of oVirt 4.4.7**

   Default DataCenter/Cluster will be set to compatibility level 4.6 on new installations of oVirt 4.4.7

 - [BZ 1966145](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1966145) **Remove version lock on specific ansible version and require ansible 2.9.z &gt;= 2.9.21 in ovirt-engine**

   ovirt-engine in RHV 4.4.7 requires ansible 2.9.z higher than 2.9.20. Also in RHV 4.4.7 version for specific ansible version has been removed, because correct ansible version shipped in RHV channels.

 - [BZ 1938101](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1938101) **Rebase on Wildfly 23**

   oVirt Engine now requires WildFly 23


#### ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap

 - [BZ 1964522](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1964522) **Allow both automatic detection of IP version available as well as manual configuration**

   To solve issues in mixed Pv4/IPv6 setups following changes has been done:



1. A new option pool.default.socketfactory.resolver.detectIPVersion

   to enable/disable automatic detection of IP protocol has been

   introduced:

    - By default set to true

    - Automatic detection of IP versions has been improved to use

      the default gateway IP addresses (if a default gateway has

      IPv4/IPv6 address, A/AAAA DNS records are used to resolve LDAP

      servers FQDNs)

    - If automatic detection is disabled, then administrators need

      to set properly below options according to their network setup



2. A new option pool.default.socketfactory.resolver.supportIPv4

   to enable/disable usage of IPv4 has been introduced:

    - By default set to false (automatic detection is preferred)

    - If set to true, type "A" DNS records are used to resolve LDAP

      servers FQDNs

   

3. Existing option pool.default.socketfactory.resolver.supportIPv6

   is used to enable/disable usage of IPv6

    - By default set to false (in previous versions it was enabled)

    - If set to true, type "AAAA" DNS records are used to resolve

      LDAP servers FQDNs



So by default automatic detection of IP version using the default gateway addresses is used, which should work for most of the setups. If there is some special mixed IPv4/IPv6 setup, where automatic detection fails, then it's needed to turn off automatic detection and configure IP versions manually as a part of /etc/ovirt-engine/aaa/&lt;PROFILE&gt;.properties configuration for specific LDAP setup.


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1947450](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1947450) **ovirt-host shouldn't have hard dependency on vdsm hooks**

   ovirt-host package now doesn't pull in any vdsm-hook anymore.

Users now can decide if to install specific vdsm hooks or not.


#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1948418](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1948418) **[RFE] Add memory, and CPU sizes to Hosts/Virtual Machines Trend dashboard**

   Feature: 

added to hosts and vms trend dashboards 2 panels. one withe the total memory size, and one with the total cpu cores.

 - [BZ 1849685](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1849685) **[RFE] Handle PKI renew for grafana**

   engine-setup now allows renewing the certificate also for grafana when it is set up on a separate machine from the engine.

 - [BZ 1952424](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1952424) **[RFE]  Add Data Source variable to all dashboards**

   Feature: Add the option to select Data Source for all dashboards.



Reason: 

This way we can navigate easily if there are several different engines (with different dwh).


#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1966177](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1966177) **[CBT][RFE] Unable to delete a vm checkpoint if vm has poweroff state**

   Feature: 

VM checkpoint can be removed while the VM is in a 'DOWN' state.



Reason: 

Until now, the VM checkpoint that was taken during a VM backup process can be removed only when the VM is running. This fix provides the ability to remove the VM checkpoint when the VM isn't running using the same API - 



DELETE /vms/123/checkpoints/456/



Result: 

VM checkpoint can be removed when the VM is 'UP' or 'DOWN' using the same API.

 - [BZ 1947450](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1947450) **ovirt-host shouldn't have hard dependency on vdsm hooks**

   ovirt-host package now doesn't pull in any vdsm-hook anymore.

Users now can decide if to install specific vdsm hooks or not.


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1849861](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1849861) **[RFE][v2v] [upload/download disk/CBT] Failed to attach disk to the VM - disk is OK but image transfer still holds a lock on the disk**

   Feature:

1. Add 2 new backup phases:

- SUCCEEDED

- FAILED

2. Disable 'vm_backups' &amp; 'image_transfers' DB tables cleanup after backup / image transfer operation is over.

3. Add DB cleanup scheduled thread to automatically clean backups and image transfers once in a while.



Reason:

After backup / image transfer operation finishes, all the execution data disappeared.

That means, that the user didn't know the final execution state of the operation that was visible via DB and API while the backup / image transfer execution was still in progress.

In case of backup operation, the situation was even worse - there was no indication for success/failure, the last thing the user might be able to see is the 'FINALIZING' status.

We want the user to be able to see the operation result, but also not over-polute the database with too old data.



Result:

1. Added 2 new backup phases to show possible execution statuses (success/failure) for backup operations.

2. Cancel DB cleanup of the 'vm_backups' &amp; 'image_transfers' DB tables when the backup / image transfer finishes to allow DB &amp; API status retrieval by user.

3. Scheduled execution of the cleanup - 15 minutes for success entries, 30 minutes for the failure. Separate values for backup &amp; for image transfer operations, an additional value for the cleanup thread rate (all 5 values are configurable).

4. Some minor user experience improvements.

 - [BZ 1966177](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1966177) **[CBT][RFE] Unable to delete a vm checkpoint if vm has poweroff state**

   Feature: 

VM checkpoint can be removed while the VM is in a 'DOWN' state.



Reason: 

Until now, the VM checkpoint that was taken during a VM backup process can be removed only when the VM is running. This fix provides the ability to remove the VM checkpoint when the VM isn't running using the same API - 



DELETE /vms/123/checkpoints/456/



Result: 

VM checkpoint can be removed when the VM is 'UP' or 'DOWN' using the same API.

 - [BZ 1913858](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1913858) **[RFE] Enable high-availability for VMs that are pinned to host(s)**

   

 - [BZ 1958081](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1958081) **[RFE] Enable ramfb for mdev with display=on**

   When a vGPU is used and nodisplay is not specified, an additional framebuffer display device is added to the VM now, allowing to display the VM console before the vGPU is initialized. This allows display console access during boot, instead of having just a blank screen there as before this change.



This works only on cluster levels &gt;= 4.5. It is possible to disable the feature by setting VgpuFramebufferSupported Engine config value to false.

 - [BZ 1953468](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1953468) **[CBT][RFE] Allow removing non-root checkpoints from the VM**

   Feature:

Allow removing any VM checkpoint from the checkpoint chain and not just the root checkpoint



Reason: 

Users should be able to remove any checkpoint from the VM backups checkpoints chain.

 

Result: 

Any checkpoint from the VM checkpoints chain can be removed and not just the root checkpoint in the chain.


#### oVirt Ansible collection

 - [BZ 1959273](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1959273) **Add the option to pause Hosted-Engine deployment before running engine-setup**

   Feature: Allow to pause Hosted-Engine deployment before running engine-setup



Reason: This allows to make changes in the bootstrap VM 



Result: Changes can be made on the Hosted-Engine VM during the deployment and before engine-setup


### Deprecated Functionality

#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1896359](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1896359) **"Count threads as cores" option is not honored by the RHV Dashboard CPU graph**

   In version 4.4.7.2 we will update the column name to number_of_threads.

In DWH we will leave the old name (threads_per_core) as another alias,

so DWH will have 2 columns with the same data: number_of_threads,threads_per_core.

In the next version we will completely delete the old name.


#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1899875](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1899875) **drop support for VM-FEX**

   


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1896359](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1896359) **"Count threads as cores" option is not honored by the RHV Dashboard CPU graph**

In DWH we will leave the old name (threads_per_core) as another alias,

so DWH will have 2 columns with the same data: number_of_threads,threads_per_core.

In the next version we will completely delete the old name.
