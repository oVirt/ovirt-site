==== Importing a Virtual Machine from a KVM Host

Import virtual machines from KVM to your {virt-product-fullname} environment. {virt-product-fullname} converts KVM virtual machines to the correct format before they are imported. You must enable public key authentication between the KVM host and at least one host in the destination data center (this host is referred to in the following procedure as the proxy host).

[WARNING]
====
The virtual machine must be shut down before being imported. Starting the virtual machine through KVM during the import process can result in data corruption.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
An import operation can only include virtual machines that share the same architecture. If any virtual machine to be imported has a different architecture, a warning appears and you are prompted to change your selection to include only virtual machines with the same architecture.
====

[NOTE]
====
If the import fails, refer to the relevant log file in */var/log/vdsm/import/* and to */var/log/vdsm/vdsm.log* on the proxy host for details.

*Importing a Virtual Machine from KVM*

. Enable public key authentication between the proxy host and the KVM host:
.. Log in to the proxy host and generate SSH keys for the *vdsm* user.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# sudo -u vdsm ssh-keygen
----
+
.. Copy the *vdsm* user's public key to the KVM host. The proxy host's *known_hosts* file will also be updated to include the host key of the KVM host.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# sudo -u vdsm ssh-copy-id root@_kvmhost.example.com_
----
+
.. Log in to the KVM host to verify that the login works correctly.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# sudo -u vdsm ssh root@_kvmhost.example.com_
----
+
. Log in to the Administration Portal.
. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines].
. Click *More Actions* (image:common/images/moreactions.png[]) and select *Import*. This opens the *Import Virtual Machine(s)* window.
. Select the *Data Center* that contains the proxy host.
. Select *KVM (via Libvirt)* from the *Source* drop-down list.
. Optionally, select a KVM provider *External Provider* from the drop-down list. The URI will be pre-filled with the correct URI. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#Adding_KVM_as_an_External_Provider[Adding a KVM Host as a Virtual Machine Provider] in the _Administration Guide_ for more information.
. Enter the *URI* of the KVM host in the following format:
+
[source,terminal]
----
qemu+ssh://root@_kvmhost.example.com_/system
----
+
. Keep the *Requires Authentication* check box selected.
. Enter `root` in the *Username* field.
. Enter the *Password* of the KVM host's root user.
. Select the *Proxy Host* from the drop-down list.
. Click *Load* to list the virtual machines on the KVM host that can be imported.
. Select one or more virtual machines from the *Virtual Machines on Source* list, and use the arrows to move them to the *Virtual Machines to Import* list.
. Click btn:[Next].
. Select the *Cluster* in which the virtual machines will reside.
. Select a *CPU Profile* for the virtual machines.
. Optionally, select the *Collapse Snapshots* check box to remove snapshot restore points and include templates in template-based virtual machines.
. Optionally, select the *Clone* check box to change the virtual machine name and MAC addresses, and clone all disks, removing all snapshots. If a virtual machine appears with a warning symbol beside its name or has a tick in the *VM in System* column, you must clone the virtual machine and change its name.
. Click each virtual machine to be imported and click the *Disks* sub-tab. Use the *Allocation Policy* and *Storage Domain* lists to select whether the disk used by the virtual machine will be thin provisioned or preallocated, and select the storage domain on which the disk will be stored. An icon is also displayed to indicate which of the disks to be imported acts as the boot disk for that virtual machine. See link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}technical_reference/index#Preallocated_Storage[Virtual Disk Storage Allocation Policies] in the _Technical Reference_ for more information.
. If you selected the *Clone* check box, change the name of the virtual machine in the *General* tab.
. Click btn:[OK] to import the virtual machines.

The CPU type of the virtual machine must be the same as the CPU type of the cluster into which it is being imported. To view the cluster's *CPU Type* in the Administration Portal:

. Click menu:Compute[Clusters].
. Select a cluster.
. Click btn:[Edit].
. Click the *General* tab.

If the CPU type of the virtual machine is different, configure the imported virtual machine's CPU type:

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines].
. Select the virtual machine.
. Click btn:[Edit].
. Click the *System* tab.
. Click the *Advanced Parameters* arrow.
. Specify the *Custom CPU Type* and click btn:[OK].
