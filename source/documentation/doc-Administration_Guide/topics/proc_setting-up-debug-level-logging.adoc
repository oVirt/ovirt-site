=== Setting debug-level logging for {virt-product-fullname} services

You can set the logs of the following {virt-product-fullname} ({virt-product-shortname}) services to debug-level by modifying the `sysconfig` file of each service.

.{virt-product-shortname} services and `sysconfig` file paths
[options="header"]
|===
|Service |File path
|`ovirt-engine.service` | `/etc/sysconfig/ovirt-engine`
|`ovirt-engine-dwhd.service` |`/etc/sysconfig/ovirt-engine-dwhd`
|`ovirt-fence-kdump-listener.service` |`/etc/sysconfig/ovirt-fence-kdump-listener`
|`ovirt-websocket-proxy.service`| `/etc/sysconfig/ovirt-websocket-proxy`
|===

This modification affects logging done by the Python wrapper, not the main service process.

Setting logging to debug-level is useful for debugging issues related to start up - for example, if the main process fails to start due to a missing or incorrect Java runtime or library.

.Prerequisites

* Verify that the `sysconfig` file you want to modify exists. If necessary, create it.

.Procedure

. Add the following to the `sysconfig` file of the service:
+
[source, terminal]
----
OVIRT_SERVICE_DEBUG=1
----
. Restart the service:
+
[source, terminal]
----
# systemctl restart <service>
----

The `sysconfig` log file of the service is now set to debug-level.

Logging caused by this setting goes to the system log, so the logs it generates can be found in `/var/log/messages`, not in the service-specific log file, or by using the `journalctl` command.
