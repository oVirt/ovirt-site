=== Starting a Virtual Machine

*Starting Virtual Machines*

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines] and select a virtual machine with a status of `Down`.
. Click btn:[Run].

The *Status* of the virtual machine changes to `Up`, and the operating system installation begins. Open a console to the virtual machine if one does not open automatically.

[NOTE]
====
A virtual machine will not start on a host that the CPU is overloaded on. By default, a host's CPU is considered overloaded if it has a load of more than 80% for 5 minutes but these values can be changed using scheduling policies. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}administration_guide/#sect-Scheduling_Policies[Scheduling Policies] in the _Administration Guide_ for more information.
