# Adding Local Storage

Storage local to your host has been prepared. Now use the Manager to add it to the host.

Adding local storage to a host in this manner causes the host to be put in a new data center and cluster. The local storage configuration window combines the creation of a data center, a cluster, and storage into a single process.
