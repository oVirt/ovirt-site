# Communication

There are a number of ways to communicate with the oVirt Community. [ Mailing lists](#Mailing_lists), [ IRC](#IRC), and our [bug tracker](http://bugzilla.redhat.com).

## IRC

*Primary channel*: #ovirt on irc.oftc.net

*   Meetings are held here.
*   This has been the main channel since moving from Freenode.

*Secondary channel*: #ovirt on irc.freenode.net

*   Some community members are in this channel to start and grow conversations with the Freenode community.
*   Conversations are encouraged to move to the primary IRC channel, but not required.

## Weekly Meetings

oVirt has a weekly synchronization meeting. Information can be seen on the [Meetings](Meetings) page.
