# Engine-Config-Utilities

## Features requested for engine configuration utilities (engine-setup, engine-upgrade, engine-cleanup)

*   Add packaging for other package managers (pkg, apt, ebuild)
*   Avoid using hard-coded or distribution specific usernames.
*   Do not use bash specific code (use sh generic instead)
