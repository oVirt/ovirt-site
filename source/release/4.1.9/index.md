# oVirt 4.1.9 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.1.9
release as of January 24, 2018.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4,
CentOS Linux 7.4 (or similar).


For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.1.9, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## What's New in 4.1.9?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1525933](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1525933) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.9] [RFE] Include katello agent in RHV-H NG</b><br>Katello Agent is included in RHV and RHVH, and installed on the hosts during deployment. Katello Agent provides a list of the installed RPMs, for better integration with Satellite.

#### OTOPI

 - [BZ 1528290](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1528290) <b>[RFE] otopi should run with rpmverbosity "debug"</b><br>otopi's yum plugin is now more verbose, logging also all rpm scriptlets's output. This can help debug failures caused by errors from such scriptlets.
 - [BZ 1518545](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1518545) <b>[RFE] otopi should log on failure list of network connections</b><br>otopi now optionally logs the list of network connections on the machine after failures. Enable this by installing the optional package otopi-debug-plugins. This can help debug failures to start network services due to "Address already in use" errors.

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1532180](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1532180) <b>add host and guest reporting for kpti/ibrs/ibpb</b><br>Feature: <br>Host General pane (in 4.2), Host General > Software subtab (in 4.1) contains new "Kernel Features" field showing PTI, IBPB and IBRS kernel features of the host system if the information is available.<br><br>VM General pane contains new "Guest CPU Type" field showing guest machine CPU type.<br><br>Reason: <br>User can easily recognize if meltdown fixes are applied.<br><br>More info on meltdown patches detection at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3317841

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1532180](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1532180) <b>add host and guest reporting for kpti/ibrs/ibpb</b><br>Feature: <br>Host General pane (in 4.2), Host General > Software subtab (in 4.1) contains new "Kernel Features" field showing PTI, IBPB and IBRS kernel features of the host system if the information is available.<br><br>VM General pane contains new "Guest CPU Type" field showing guest machine CPU type.<br><br>Reason: <br>User can easily recognize if meltdown fixes are applied.<br><br>More info on meltdown patches detection at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3317841
 - [BZ 1533061](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1533061) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.9] [RFE] Warn user about VMs that have pending snapshot removal retries</b><br>When live or cold merge fails, snapshot disks may be left in an illegal state. If virtual machines with illegal snapshot disks are shut down, they will not re-start. Virtual machines with illegal snapshot disks are now marked with an exclamation mark and a warning message not to shut them down.
 - [BZ 1531016](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1531016) <b>add IBRS CPUs</b><br>This update adds IBRS-enabled CPU Models to Cluster. Thay can be used to mitigate Spectre vulnerability in guests<br>Refer to https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3307851

### Known Issue

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1516494](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1516494) <b>VDSM command GetVmsInfoVDS failed: Missing OVF file from VM</b><br>Cause: <br>The issue is caused by having an empty VM directory in the vms directory in the export domain.<br>Consequence: <br>This will result in an error when trying to read VMs stored in the export domain and will cause endless SPM re-elections.<br>Fix: <br>This issue no longer causes SPM re-election. To fix the VM list loading, it is required to remove the empty the directory manually.<br>Result:
