=== Search: Multiple Criteria and Wildcards

Wildcards can be used in the `<value>` part of the syntax for strings. For example, to find all users beginning with *m*, enter `m*`.

You can perform a search having two criteria by using the Boolean operators `AND` and `OR`. For example:

`Vms: users.name = m* AND status = Up`

This query returns all running virtual machines for users whose names begin with "m".

`Vms: users.name = m* AND tag = "paris-loc"`

This query returns all virtual machines tagged with "paris-loc" for users whose names begin with "m".

When two criteria are specified without `AND` or `OR`, `AND` is implied. `AND` precedes `OR`, and `OR` precedes implied `AND`.
