==== Adding Network Labels to Host Network Interfaces

Using network labels allows you to greatly simplify the administrative workload associated with assigning logical networks to host network interfaces. Setting a label on a role network (for instance, a migration network or a display network) causes a mass deployment of that network on all hosts. Such mass additions of networks are achieved through the use of DHCP. This method of mass deployment was chosen over a method of typing in static addresses, because of the unscalable nature of the task of typing in many static IP addresses.

There are two methods of adding labels to a host network interface:

* Manually, in the Administration Portal
* Automatically, with the LLDP Labeler service

*Adding Network Labels in the Administration Portal*

. Click menu:Compute[Hosts].
. Click the host's name. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Network Interfaces* tab.
. Click *Setup Host Networks*.
. Click *Labels* and right-click *[New Label]*. Select a physical network interface to label.
. Enter a name for the network label in the *Label* text field.
. Click btn:[OK].

*Adding Network Labels with the LLDP Labeler Service*

You can automate the process of assigning labels to host network interfaces in the configured list of clusters with the LLDP Labeler service.

You have added a network label to a host network interface. Newly created logical networks with the same label are automatically assigned to all host network interfaces with that label. Removing a label from a logical network automatically removes that logical network from all host network interfaces with that label.
