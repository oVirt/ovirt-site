# Attaching an Existing Export Domain to a Data Center

**Note:** The export storage domain is deprecated. Storage data domains can be unattached from a data center and imported to another data center in the same environment, or in a different environment. Virtual machines, floating virtual disk images, and templates can then be uploaded from the imported storage domain to the attached data center. See [Importing Existing Storage Domains](sect-Importing_Existing_Storage_Domains) for information on importing storage domains.

An export domain that is **Unattached** can be attached to a data center. Only one export domain can be attached to a data center.
