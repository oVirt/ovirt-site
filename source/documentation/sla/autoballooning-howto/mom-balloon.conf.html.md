    # Set this to an existing, writable directory to enable plotting.  For each
    # invocation of the program a subdirectory momplot-NNN will be created where NNN
    # is a sequence number.  Within that directory, tab-delimited data files will be
    # created and updated with all data generated by the configured Collectors.
