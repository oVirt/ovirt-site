==== Attaching an Existing Export Domain to a Data Center

[NOTE]
====
The export storage domain is deprecated. Storage data domains can be unattached from a data center and imported to another data center in the same environment, or in a different environment. Virtual machines, floating virtual disks, and templates can then be uploaded from the imported storage domain to the attached data center. See xref:sect-Importing_Existing_Storage_Domains[] for information on importing storage domains.

An export domain that is *Unattached* can be attached to a data center. Only one export domain can be attached to a data center.
