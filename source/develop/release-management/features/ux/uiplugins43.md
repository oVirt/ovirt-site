## Overview

oVirt web administration application (WebAdmin) is the main graphical user interface for managing all components of a virtual system infrastructure. In addition to existing WebAdmin functionality, there can be times when administrators want to expose additional features or to integrate with other systems through WebAdmin UI. This is where UI plugins come into play: each plugin represents a set of user interface extensions that can be packaged and distributed for deployment on oVirt Engine via WebAdmin.

## Introduction

UI plugins integrate with WebAdmin directly on the client (web browser) using [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) programming language. Plugin invocation is driven by WebAdmin and happens right within the context of browser's JavaScript runtime, using JavaScript language as the lowest common denominator between WebAdmin ([GWT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit)) and individual plugins. UI plugins can take full advantage of JavaScript language and its rich ecosystem of libraries. There are no specific rules on how to implement UI plugins, plugin API is designed to be simple and not to get in developer's way, regardless of how a developer chooses to write the plugin.

At key events during runtime, WebAdmin invokes individual plugins via [event handler functions](#application-event-reference) representing WebAdmin → plugin communication. Even though WebAdmin supports many different event handler functions, a plugin only declares functions which are of interest to its implementation. Each plugin must register relevant event handler functions as part of its [bootstrap sequence](#plugin-bootstrap-sequence), before the plugin is put to use by WebAdmin.

To facilitate plugin → WebAdmin communication that drives UI extension, WebAdmin exposes [plugin API](#api-function-reference) as global (top-level) `pluginApi` JavaScript object for individual plugins to consume. Each plugin obtains specific `pluginApi` instance, allowing WebAdmin to control plugin API function invocation per each plugin with regard to [plugin lifecycle](#plugin-lifecycle).

## Discovering plugins

Before a plugin can be [loaded](#loading-plugins) and [bootstrapped](#plugin-bootstrap-sequence) by WebAdmin, it has to be discovered by UI plugin infrastructure in the first place.

![](/images/wiki/Discovering-plugins.png "Discovering plugins")

[Plugin descriptor](#plugin-descriptor) is the entry point to discovery process, containing plugin meta-data as well as (optional) default plugin-specific configuration.

As part of handling WebAdmin HTML page request (1), UI plugin infrastructure attempts to discover and load plugin descriptors from local file system (2). For each descriptor, the infrastructure also attempts to load corresponding [plugin user configuration](#plugin-user-configuration) used to override default plugin-specific configuration (if any) and tweak plugin runtime behavior. Note that providing plugin user configuration is completely optional. After loading descriptors and corresponding user configuration files (if any), oVirt Engine aggregates UI plugin data and embeds it into WebAdmin HTML page for runtime evaluation (3).

Descriptor files are expected to reside in `$ENGINE_USR/ui-plugins` directory, with default mapping `ENGINE_USR=/usr/share/ovirt-engine` as defined by oVirt Engine local configuration. Descriptor files should comply with [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format specification with the addition of allowing Java/C++ style comments, i.e. both `/* comment */` and `// comment` varieties.

User configuration files are expected to reside in `$ENGINE_ETC/ui-plugins` directory, with default mapping `ENGINE_ETC=/etc/ovirt-engine` as defined by oVirt Engine local configuration. User configuration files should comply with same content format rules as descriptors. Note that user configuration files follow `-config.json` naming convention, i.e. using `-config` suffix.

## Loading plugins

After a plugin has been [discovered](#discovering-plugins) and its data embedded into WebAdmin HTML page, WebAdmin will attempt to load the given plugin as part of application startup (unless configured otherwise).

![](/images/wiki/Loading-plugins.png "Loading plugins")

For each plugin, WebAdmin creates hidden HTML `iframe` element used to load [plugin host page](#plugin-host-page) (1). Plugin host page is the entry point to [bootstrap](#plugin-bootstrap-sequence) process, used to evaluate plugin code (JavaScript) within the context of the corresponding `iframe` element. UI plugin infrastructure supports serving plugin resource files, such as host page, from local file system (2). Host page gets loaded into `iframe` element and plugin code is evaluated (3). From this point forward, plugin communicates with WebAdmin via plugin API (4). Since the purpose of host page is to bootstrap plugin code, any UI extensions should be done via [plugin API](#api-function-reference) rather than direct HTML DOM manipulation.

Plugin resource files are expected to reside in `$ENGINE_USR/ui-plugins/` directory, with `resourcePath` value defined by the corresponding attribute in [plugin descriptor](#plugin-descriptor). For example:

*   Client requests URL `/ovirt-engine/webadmin/plugin/path/to/file`
*   Engine serves content of `$ENGINE_USR/ui-plugins/path/to/file`

## Plugin descriptor

Plugin descriptor contains plugin meta-data as well as default plugin-specific configuration.

Following code snippet shows a sample plugin descriptor:

      /usr/share/ovirt-engine/ui-plugins/example.json

    {

        // Unique name of the plugin (required)
        // Unrelated to descriptor file name, must not be empty
        "name": "ExamplePlugin",

        // URL of plugin host page that bootstraps plugin code (required)
        // This URL maps to $ENGINE_USR/ui-plugins/example-resources/plugin.html
        "url": "plugin/ExamplePlugin/plugin.html",

        // Default configuration associated with the plugin (optional)
        "config": { "band": "ZZ Top", "score": 10 },

        // Path to plugin resource files relative to descriptor (optional)
        // Required when using UI plugin infrastructure to serve plugin resource files
        // This path maps to $ENGINE_USR/ui-plugins/example-resources
        "resourcePath": "example-resources"

    }

Notice the use of relative URL in `url` attribute. Since WebAdmin resides in `/ovirt-engine/webadmin` URL context, it's usually best to use relative URLs when referring to plugin resource files. This way, the plugin is more resilient to potential changes in WebAdmin base URL.

## Plugin user configuration

Plugin user configuration contains custom plugin-specific configuration and attributes to tweak plugin runtime behavior.

Following code snippet shows a sample plugin user configuration:

      /etc/ovirt-engine/ui-plugins/example-config.json

    {

        // Custom configuration associated with the plugin (optional)
        // This overrides default configuration within descriptor, if any
        "config": { "band": "AC/DC" },

        // Whether the plugin should be loaded on WebAdmin startup (optional)
        // Default value is true
        "enabled": true,

        // Relative order in which the plugin will be loaded (optional)
        // Default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE (lowest order)
        "order": 0

    }

As part of [discovering plugins](#discovering-plugins), UI plugin infrastructure will merge custom configuration (if any) on top of default configuration (if any). For example:

*   Plugin descriptor defines `config` attribute as `{ "band": "ZZ Top", "score": 10 }`
*   Plugin user configuration defines `config` attribute as `{ "band": "AC/DC" }`
*   Resulting plugin configuration, accessible to given plugin at runtime, will be `{ "band": "AC/DC", "score": 10 }`

## Plugin host page

Plugin host page [bootstraps](#plugin-bootstrap-sequence) plugin code by evaluating JavaScript within the context of the corresponding `iframe` element.

Following code snippet shows a sample plugin host page:

      /usr/share/ovirt-engine/ui-plugins/example-resources/plugin.html

            // Plugin code, evaluated within HTML head section (2)

            // Plugin code, evaluated within HTML body section (3)

Prior to evaluating actual plugin code, host page can load dependent scripts or other resources as necessary (1). Plugin code can be evaluated either within `head` (2) or `body` (3) section of the HTML document. In addition to embedding plugin code inline into host page, code can be also loaded asynchronously as external script, i.e. ``

. There are no specific rules on how to load plugin code within the host page, the only requirement is that loading host page HTML document should evaluate plugin code eventually.

Note that WebAdmin [loads](#loading-plugins) the given plugin via hidden HTML `iframe` element. This has following implications:

*   Plugin code runs within the context of the corresponding `iframe` element, i.e. not in WebAdmin (top-level) context
*   Plugin code should use [plugin API](#api-function-reference) to make UI extensions, i.e. avoid direct HTML DOM manipulation of WebAdmin UI
*   Any markup placed within HTML `body` section will have no effect since the `iframe` element is hidden from WebAdmin view

Notice the use of relative URL to load additional script in above snippet. According to [plugin descriptor](#plugin-descriptor), the host page resides in `/ovirt-engine/webadmin/plugin/ExamplePlugin` URL context. From this context, we can refer to plugin resource files directly using relative paths.

## Why load plugins via iframe element?

From UI plugin infrastructure perspective, each plugin represents a standalone web application that integrates with WebAdmin through [plugin API](#api-function-reference).

Each plugin can load dependent scripts or other resources scoped to its own context, i.e. `Window` object for the corresponding `iframe` element. The `iframe` element is essentially a sandbox for evaluating plugin code:

*   WebAdmin UI won't break when some plugin breaks - instead, WebAdmin puts the misbehaving plugin out of service
*   WebAdmin DOM won't be polluted with dependencies (external scripts or other resources) of individual plugins
*   WebAdmin vs. plugin integration happens through plugin API, discouraging direct HTML DOM manipulation of WebAdmin UI which would impose a fragile, HTML structure dependant bond between plugin and WebAdmin

Aside from [plugin host page](#plugin-host-page), any custom UI contributed by a plugin follows the same principles as mentioned above.

## Plugin bootstrap sequence

Plugin code that runs due to host page being loaded typically follows a common pattern:

*   Get `pluginApi` instance for the given plugin
*   Get runtime plugin configuration (optional)
*   Customize API options that affect specific features of plugin API (optional)
*   Register relevant [event handler functions](#application-event-reference)
*   When ready, notify UI plugin infrastructure to proceed with plugin initialization

Following code snippet illustrates the above mentioned pattern:

    // Get plugin API for "ExamplePlugin", using "parent" due to plugin code being evaluated within an iframe context
    // Note that "parent.pluginApi" is subject to Same-Origin Policy, this implies WebAdmin HTML page and plugin host
    // page must be on same origin, which holds true when using UI plugin infrastructure to serve plugin resource files
    var api = parent.pluginApi('ExamplePlugin');

    // Get runtime plugin configuration, i.e. custom configuration (if any) merged on top of default configuration (if any)
    var cfg = api.configObject();

    // Customize API options that affect specific features of plugin API, i.e. override default API options
    api.options({ ... });

    // Register relevant event handler functions for later invocation by UI plugin infrastructure
    api.register({ ... });

    // Notify UI plugin infrastructure to proceed with plugin initialization, i.e. expect UiInit event callback
    api.ready();

## Plugin lifecycle

UI plugin infrastructure maintains a common lifecycle to control execution of individual plugins. The lifecycle consists of possible states and transitions between these states at runtime.

![](/images/wiki/Plugin-lifecycle.png "Plugin lifecycle")

DEFINED

The plugin has been defined through its meta-data. A corresponding `iframe` element has been created. This is the initial state for all plugins.

LOADING

The `iframe` element has been attached to DOM, causing plugin host page to be fetched asynchronously in the background. We are waiting for the plugin to report back as ready.

READY

The plugin has indicated that it is ready for use. We expect the event handler object (object containing [event handler functions](#application-event-reference)) to be registered by now. While in plugin invocation context`*`, proceed with plugin initialization. Otherwise, initialize the plugin upon entering next invocation context.

INITIALIZING

The plugin is being initialized by calling `UiInit` event handler function. The `UiInit` function will be called just once during the lifetime of a plugin, before calling other event handler functions.

IN USE

The `UiInit` function completed successfully, WebAdmin will call other event handler functions as necessary. The plugin is in use.

FAILED

An uncaught exception escaped while calling plugin event handler function, indicating internal error within plugin code. The `iframe` element has been detached from DOM. The plugin is removed from service.

`*` Plugin invocation context starts when user logs into WebAdmin and ends when user logs out. Processing [event handler functions](#application-event-reference) as well as [plugin API](#api-function-reference) calls is constrained by this context, i.e. plugins are in effect only while user stays authenticated in WebAdmin UI.

## Plugin development tips

### Avoid mixed content issues

If WebAdmin HTML page is served over HTTPS, WebAdmin and UI plugins should retrieve all content from remote servers through HTTPS in order not to compromise security of the whole application. When HTML page served over HTTPS includes content retrieved through cleartext HTTP, it's called mixed content page.

There are generally two types of [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent):

*   mixed active content - content through which an attacker could gain access to all or parts of web page: `script` element, `iframe` element, `XMLHttpRequest` object, etc.
*   mixed passive content - content that cannot access or alter web page: `img` element, etc.

Modern browsers typically block mixed active content and allow mixed passive content by default.

When requesting content from remote servers, UI plugins should ensure that requests are made through HTTPS in case WebAdmin HTML page is served over HTTPS. In other words, UI plugins shouldn't compromise security of the whole application.

For example, to load remote script using protocol of enclosing web page: ``

### Working with SSO tokens

Upon successful login, WebAdmin acquires an SSO token that can be used to obtain new HTTP sessions, for instance with the REST api. Plugins are responsible for maintaining their own HTTP sessions created using the SSO token. To prevent closing the HTTP session after processing given request, UI plugins should always include `Prefer: persistent-auth` header in all requests.

To Acquire a new HTTP session from for instance the REST api, the plugin should add the `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` header to the request. Where token is the SSO token obtained from the ssoToken UI plugin function.

Following code snippet illustrates above mentioned practices using `XMLHttpRequest` object:

    var ssoToken = api.ssoToken();
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { /* process response when done */ };
    xhr.open('GET', 'http://example-host/ovirt-engine/api', true);
    xhr.withCredentials = true; // for cross-site requests, ensure that auth information and cookies are included
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json'); // control response format
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Filter', 'false'); // control whether to filter results based on (WebAdmin) user's permissions
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Prefer', 'persistent-auth'); // prevent closing REST API session after processing request
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + ssoToken); // Create HTTP session with SSO token, subsequent requests don't need this as the HTTP session is persistent.
    xhr.send(null);

## Terms used in API reference

### JavaScript interface object

Object implementing a contract (interface) by declaring corresponding functions. Unlike the traditional concept of interface abstract type in object-oriented languages, an interface object doesn't necessarily have to declare all functions of the given interface in order to "implement" such interface. In fact, an empty object can be used as a valid interface object. Missing functions will be treated as empty (no-op) functions with default return values, as defined by the contract of such functions. An interface object can "implement" multiple interfaces simply by declaring functions of those interfaces.

## Application event reference

### Core functions

    UiInit

Called by the infrastructure as part of plugin initialization. The `UiInit` function will be called just once during the lifetime of a plugin, before WebAdmin calls other event handler functions. This function is a good place for one-time UI extensions.

### Authentication

#### UserLogin

Argument(s)

    string userNameWithDomain
    string userId

Called after a user logs into WebAdmin. The `userNameWithDomain` follows `user@domain` convention.

#### UserLogout

Called after a user logs out of WebAdmin.

### Main view grid item selection

#### {EntityType}SelectionChange

Called when item selection changes in the given main view. Replace `{EntityType}` with name of desired entity. Refer to [entity types](#entity-type-reference) for details on supported entities and their object representations.

    api.register({
        DataCenterSelectionChange: function() {
            var firstSelectedItem = (arguments.length > 0) ? arguments[0] : null;
            var firstSelectedItemId = firstSelectedItem && firstSelectedItem.id;
        }
    });

### Cross-window messaging

#### MessageReceived

Argument(s)

    string or `object data'
    object sourceWindow

Called when another `Window` (i.e. custom UI contributed by a plugin) sends message to WebAdmin `Window` via HTML5 [postMessage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Messaging) API. In a typical scenario, custom UI living in `iframe` context sends message to WebAdmin (parent) `Window` which in turn dispatches the message to individual plugins. Refer to `allowedMessageOrigins` in [API options](#api-option-reference) for details on customizing origins from which messages will be accepted. The `sourceWindow` can be used to establish two-way communication between plugin code and sender's `Window` object. Note that some browsers might support only `string` values when passing data through HTML5 postMessage API.

`*` If specified, `arguments` represent the implicit JavaScript [function argument object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments).

## API function reference

### Core functions

#### register

Argument(s)

    object eventHandlerObject

Registers the event handler object, i.e. object containing [event handler functions](#application-event-reference) which facilitate WebAdmin → plugin communication. The `register` function must be called with valid `eventHandlerObject` before calling `ready` function. The `eventHandlerObject` must be an object declaring event handler functions as its properties, or an empty object. After the `eventHandlerObject` has been set for given plugin, calling `register` function has no effect.

    api.register({
        UiInit: function() {
            api.addDetailPlace('Host', 'Special Host Tab', 'special-host-tab',
                'plugin/ExamplePlugin/special-tab.html');
            api.setPlaceAccessible('special-host-tab', false);
        },
        HostSelectionChange: function() {
            var isSpecial = arguments.length == 1 && arguments[0].name.indexOf('special') != -1;
            api.setPlaceAccessible('special-host-tab', isSpecial);
        }
    });


#### options

Argument(s)

    object apiOptionsObject

Provides custom API options that affect specific features of plugin API, overriding default API options. The `options` function can be called anytime during the lifetime of a plugin. Refer to [API options](#api-option-reference) for details.

    api.options({
        allowedMessageOrigins: ['http://one.com', 'https://two.org']
    });

#### ready

Notifies the infrastructure to proceed with plugin initialization, calling `UiInit` event handler function (if defined) as soon as the plugin invocation context is entered (refer to [plugin lifecycle](#plugin-lifecycle) for details). The `register` function must be called with valid `eventHandlerObject` before calling `ready` function, otherwise the `ready` function has no effect.

    api.ready();

#### configObject

Returns the runtime plugin configuration object containing custom configuration (if any) merged on top of default configuration (if any). Refer to [plugin user configuration](#plugin-user-configuration) for details. In case neither the default nor custom configuration is available for given plugin, the `configObject` function returns an empty object.

    var conf = api.configObject();
    var favoriteBand = conf.band || ;

### Authentication

#### loginUserName

Returns user name and domain of currently logged in user, following `user@domain` convention.

    var userNameWithDomain = api.loginUserName();
    var domain = userNameWithDomain.substring(userNameWithDomain.indexOf('@') + 1);

#### loginUserId

Returns [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) of currently logged in user.

    var userId = api.loginUserId();

### Main Views and detail tabs

#### addPrimaryMenuPlace

Argument(s)

    string label
    string historyToken
    string contentUrl
    object options

Adds new primary menu place with content provided from given URL. All arguments are required except for `options`. The `label` is the text displayed in the primary menu. The `historyToken` serves as unique identifier of the place, with its value reflected in browser URL. Recommended `historyToken` format is `letters-with-dashes`. The `contentUrl` is passed to `src` attribute of the `iframe` element which renders the place content. Primary menu places cannot have secondary menu items, only primary menu containers can. The `options` can be undefined, null or object containing additional tab options:

*   `priority` - controls tab's relative priority within the tab panel, default value is `Number.MAX_VALUE`
*   `defaultPlace` - controls if the application should display this place by default when the user logs in, and no target place is defined in the browser URL.
*   `icon` - The icon to use in the primary menu. This can either be a font-awesome or patternfly icon.

<!-- -->

    api.addPrimaryMenuPlace('Custom Menu Item', 'custom-place-one',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/one.html'
    );
    api.addPrimaryMenuPlace('Custom Menu Item', 'custom-place-two',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/two.html',
        {
            priority: -1, // negative priority will be the top menu item.
            defaultPlace: true, // Go to this location if no place is defined in URL.
            icon: 'fa-trophy' // font-awesome trophy icon.
        }
    );

#### addPrimaryMenuContainer
    
Argument(s)

    String label
    String primaryMenuId
    Object options

Adds new primary menu container that allows for secondary menu places. All arguments are required except for `options`. The `label` is the text displayed in the primary menu. The `primaryMenuId` is a plugin provided identifier that allows plugins to pass that identifier to `addSecondaryMenuPlace`, so the infra structure knows which primary container to add the secondary menu place to. The `options` can be undefined, null or object containing additional tab options:

*   `priority` - controls tab's relative priority within the tab panel, default value is `Number.MAX_VALUE`
*   `icon` - The icon to use in the primary menu. This can either be a font-awesome or patternfly icon.

<!-- -->

    api.addPrimaryMenuContainer('Custom Menu Container', 'containerIdentifier');

    api.addPrimaryMenuContainer('Custom Menu Container', 'containerIdentifier',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/two.html',
        {
            priority: -1, // negative priority will be the top menu item.
            icon: 'fa-trophy' // font-awesome trophy icon.
        }
    );

#### addSecondaryMenuPlace

Argument(s)

    String primaryMenuId
    String label
    String historyToken
    String contentUrl
    Object options

Adds new secondary menu place with content provided from given URL. All arguments are required except for `options`. The primaryMenuId corresponds to the primary menu container you want the secondary menu to appear in. The `label` is the text displayed in the primary menu. The `historyToken` serves as unique identifier of the place, with its value reflected in browser URL. Recommended `historyToken` format is `letters-with-dashes`. The `contentUrl` is passed to `src` attribute of the `iframe` element which renders the place content. The `options` can be undefined, null or object containing additional tab options:

*   `priority` - controls tab's relative priority within the tab panel, default value is `Number.MAX_VALUE`

<!-- -->

    api.addSecondaryMenuPlace('Secondary Menu Item', 'custom-place',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/secondary.html'
    );
    api.addSecondaryMenuPlace('Secondary Menu Item', 'custom-place',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/secondary.html'
        {
            priority: -1, // negative priority will be the top menu item.
        }
    );
    

#### addDetailPlace

Argument(s)

    string entityTypeName
    string label
    string historyToken
    string contentUrl
    object options

Adds a new detail place with content provided from given URL. All arguments are required except for `options`. Semantics of `label`, `historyToken`, and `contentUrl` are identical to ones declared by `addPrimaryMenuPlace` function. `options` only supports priority. The `entityTypeName` identifies which entity type this detail place is associated withm. Refer to [entity types](#entity-type-reference) for details on supported entity names. The label specifies the label of the detail tab that is associated with the place of the `historyToken`. The `options` can be undefined, null or object containing additional tab options:

*   `priority` - controls tab's relative priority within the tab panel, default value is `Number.MAX_VALUE`

<!-- -->

    api.addDetailPlace('Host', 'Custom Host Tab One', 'custom-host-tab-one',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/host-one.html'
    );
    api.addDetailPlace('Host', 'Custom Host Tab Two, 'custom-host-tab-two',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/host-two.html',
        {
            priority: 3 // Third tab in the detail view.
        }
    );

#### setPlaceContentUrl

Argument(s)

    string historyToken
    string contentUrl

Updates the content URL of a given place. Semantics of `historyToken` and `contentUrl` are identical to ones declared by `addPrimaryMenuPlace` or `addDetailPlace` function. The `setPlaceContentUrl` function works only for places added via plugin API.

    api.setPlaceContentUrl('custom-place', 'plugin/ExamplePlugin/place-content.html');

#### setPlaceAccessible

Arguments(s)

      string historyToken
      boolean placeAccessible

Controls the accessibility of a given place. Semantics of `historyToken` is identical to ones declared by `addPrimaryMenuPlace` or `addDetailPlace` function. If `placeAccessible` is `false`, corresponding menu item or tab header will be hidden in WebAdmin UI and attempts to reveal the given tab manually by manipulating URL will be denied. The `setPlaceAccessible` function works only for places added via plugin API.

    api.setPlaceAccessible('custom-place', false);

#### addMenuPlaceActionButton

Argument(s)

      string entityTypeName
      string label
      object actionButtonInterface

Adds new button to the action panel and context menu for the given main view associated with the entityTypeName. Semantics of `entityTypeName` is identical to one declared by `addDetailPlace` function. The `label` is the text displayed on button. The `actionButtonInterface` is an [interface object](#javascript-interface-object) that overrides button behavior via following properties:

*   `onClick` - function called when user clicks the button, arguments are items currently selected in given main view, no-op by default
*   `isEnabled` - function called to determine whether the button should be enabled (clickable), arguments are items currently selected in given main view, returns `true` by default
*   `isAccessible` - function called to determine whether the button should be accessible (visible), arguments are items currently selected in given main view, returns `true` by default

<!-- -->

    api.addMenuPlaceActionButton('Host', 'Custom Button', {
        onClick: function() {
            var selectedHost = arguments[0];
            var isSpecial = selectedHost.name.indexOf('special') != -1;
            api.setPlaceAccessible('custom-tab', isSpecial);
        },
        isEnabled: function() {
            return arguments.length == 1;
        }
    });

#### addDetailPlaceActionButton

Argument(s)

    string mainEntityTypeName
    string detailEntityTypeName
    string label
    object actionButtonInterface

Adds new button to the action panel and context menu for the given detail tab. Semantics of `label` and `actionButtonInterface` are identical to ones declared by `addMenuPlaceActionButton` function. The `mainEntityTypeName` and `detailEntityTypeName` together identify existing detail tab to which the newly added button should be associated. Refer to [entity types](#entity-type-reference) for details on supported entity names.

    api.addDetailPlaceActionButton('Host', 'Event', 'Custom Button', {
        onClick: function() {
            var selectedHostEvent = arguments[0];
            var isSpecial = selectedHostEvent.message.indexOf('special') != -1;
            api.setPlaceAccessible('custom-tab', isSpecial);
        },
        isEnabled: function() {
            return arguments.length == 1;
        }
    });

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Limitation:** `subTabEntityTypeName` currently supports only `Event` value.

### Dialogs

#### showDialog

Argument(s)

    string title
    string dialogToken
    string contentUrl
    string width
    string height
    object options

Shows new dialog with content provided from given URL. All arguments are required except for `options`. The `title` is the text displayed on dialog header. The `dialogToken` serves as unique identifier of the dialog. The `dialogToken` can be null in case the plugin doesn't need to reference the dialog after showing it, i.e. in case the dialog is meant to be closed via close icon or by pressing Escape key. Recommended `dialogToken` format is `letters-with-dashes`. The `contentUrl` is passed to `src` attribute of the iframe element which renders dialog content. The `width` and `height` are used to define dialog dimensions in CSS units. The `options` can be undefined, null or object containing additional dialog options:

*   `buttons` - array defining buttons to display in dialog's footer area, empty by default, each element is an [interface object](#javascript-interface-object) that overrides button behavior via following properties:
    -   `label` - controls text displayed on button, default value is empty string
    -   `onClick` - function called when user clicks the button, no arguments, no-op by default
*   `closeIconVisible` - controls whether the close icon (located in right-hand part of dialog header) is visible, default value is `true`
*   `closeOnEscKey` - controls whether the dialog can be closed by pressing Escape key, default value is `true`

    api.showDialog('Custom Dialog One', 'custom-dialog-one',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/dialog-one.html',
        '640px', '480px'
    );
    api.showDialog('Custom Dialog Two', 'custom-dialog-two',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/dialog-two.html',
        '640px', '480px',
        {
            buttons: [
                {
                    label: 'Close',
                    onClick: function() {
                        api.closeDialog('custom-dialog-two');
                    }
                }
            ],
            closeIconVisible: false,
            closeOnEscKey: false
        }
    );

#### setDialogContentUrl

Argument(s)

    string dialogToken
    string contentUrl

Updates the content URL of given dialog. Semantics of `dialogToken` and `contentUrl` are identical to ones declared by `showDialog` function. The `setDialogContentUrl` function has no effect if the given dialog is already closed. The `setDialogContentUrl` function works only for dialogs shown via plugin API.

    api.setDialogContentUrl('custom-dialog',
        'plugin/ExamplePlugin/dialog-content.html');

#### closeDialog

Argument(s)

    string dialogToken

Closes the given dialog. Semantics of `dialogToken` is identical to one declared by `showDialog` function. Once closed, the dialog is destroyed.

    api.closeDialog('custom-dialog');

### Navigation

#### revealPlace

Argument(s)

    string historyToken

Reveals the given application place, e.g. standard or plugin-contributed main tab. The `historyToken` denotes a logical place of the web application, represented as `#historyToken` in application's URL.

    api.revealPlace('hosts');

### Search

#### setSearchString

Argument(s)

    string searchString

Applies the given search string to the currently active main view place. The `searchString` is the text to apply into the currently active place search panel.

    api.setSearchString('name = abc');

#### ssoToken

Returns an SSO token which can be used to authenticate the current user against the engine. This is useful to obtain an authenticated HTTP session for the REST api for instance.

    var ssoToken = api.ssoToken();

#### engineBaseUrl

Returns the base URL of the engine. This is useful if you wish to access some of the engines CSS classes or other services.

    var baseUrl = api.engineBaseUrl();

#### currentLocale

Returns the locale that has been selected by the user when they logged in. The locale is return in xx_YY format, for instance en_US or ja_JP.

    var locale = api.currentLocale();

## API option reference

### Supported plugin API options 

#### Cross-window messaging

Acceptable value(s)

    string or string[] allowedMessageOrigins

Default value

    empty array

Defines [origins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy#Origin_determination_rules) from which `message` events will be accepted and dispatched to plugin via `MessageReceived` event handler function. The value can be a string (single origin) or a string array (multiple origins). `*` translates to "any origin", as per HTML5 [postMessage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Messaging) specification. Refer to `MessageReceived` function for details on cross-window messaging workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Limitation:** plugins currently have to customize `allowedMessageOrigins` value to accept messages that originate from content served through UI plugin infrastructure, i.e. plugin resource files requested as `/ovirt-engine/webadmin/plugin/path/to/file`. Since Engine origin is generally considered safe, `allowedMessageOrigins` default value should be changed to Engine origin, see [RFE ticket](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/972226).
