You can install Cockpit for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.


.Procedure

. Install the dashboard packages:
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]

----

# yum install cockpit-ovirt-dashboard

----

. Enable and start the `cockpit.socket` service:
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
+
----
# systemctl enable cockpit.socket
# systemctl start cockpit.socket

----
. Check if Cockpit is an active service in the firewall:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --list-services
----
+
You should see `cockpit` listed. If it is not, enter the following with root permissions to add `cockpit` as a service to your firewall:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=cockpit
----
+
The `--permanent` option keeps the `cockpit` service active after rebooting.
