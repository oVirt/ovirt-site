All CPUs must have support for the Intel® 64 or AMD64 CPU extensions, and the AMD-V™ or Intel VT® hardware virtualization extensions enabled. Support for the No eXecute flag (NX) is also required.

The following CPU models are supported:

* AMD
** Opteron G4
** Opteron G5
** EPYC
* Intel
** Nehalem
** Westmere
** SandyBridge
** IvyBridge
** Haswell
** Broadwell
** Skylake Client
** Skylake Server
** Cascadelake Server

ifndef::SHE_cli_deploy[]
* IBM
** POWER8
** POWER9
endif::SHE_cli_deploy[]

ifdef::ovirt-doc[]
{enterprise-linux} 9 doesn't support virtualization for ppc64le: link:https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Virtualization[CentOS Virtualization SIG] is working
on re-introducing virtualization support but it's not ready yet.

The oVirt project also provides packages for the 64-bit ARM architecture (ARM 64) but only as a Technology Preview.

For each CPU model with security updates, the *CPU Type* lists a basic type and a secure type. For example:

* *Intel Cascadelake Server Family*
* *Secure Intel Cascadelake Server Family*

The Secure CPU type contains the latest updates. For details, see BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1731395[1731395]
