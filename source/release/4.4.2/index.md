# oVirt 4.4.2 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.2 release as of September 17, 2020.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and
CentOS Linux 8.2 (or similar).

To find out how to interact with oVirt developers and users and ask questions,
visit our [community page](/community/).
All issues or bugs should be reported via
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).


If you'd like to try oVirt as quickly as possible, follow the instructions on
the [Download](/download/) page.

For complete installation, administration, and usage instructions, see
the [oVirt Documentation](/documentation/).

For a general overview of oVirt, read the [About oVirt](/community/about.html)
page.

To learn about features introduced before 4.4.2, see the
[release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).

## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**, 

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.2 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.2 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.2).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath” to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.2?

### Release Note

#### oVirt dependencies

 - [BZ 1851092](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1851092) **Package ovirt-engine missing java dependencies in a RPM**

   ovirt-dependency package has been added to the oVirt distribution providing binary java dependencies previously bundled within oVirt Engine packages.


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1749803](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1749803) **[RFE] Improve workflow for storage migration of VMs with multiple disks**

   This enhancement enables you to set the same target domain for multiple disks. 



Previously, when moving or copying multiple disks, you needed to set the target domain for each disk separately. Now, if a common target domain exists, you can set it as the target domain for all disks.



If there is no common storage domain, such that not all disks are moved or copied to the same storage domain, set the common target domain as 'Mixed'.

 - [BZ 1860309](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1860309) **Upgrade to GWT 2.9.0**

   Feature: 

Upgrade GWT (Google Web Toolkit) version from 2.8.0 to 2.9.0



Reason: 

1. support for building with Java 11

2. accumulated improvements and bug fixes (from versions 2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.9.0)

 - [BZ 1837873](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1837873) **[RFE] No warning/blocking when detaching storage domain when there are VMs with disk on the detached domain and second disk on other domain**

   Feature: 

Warn on detaching a storage domain having VMs/templates with disks on another storage domain.



Reason:

When a user wants to detach a storage domain that contains

VMs/templates, their disks should be moved to a storage domain used for migration.

Currently, when that entity also has multiple disks on a different storage domain, its future migration might get complicated and split into two partial entities instead. 



Result:

In order to avoid the entity's split, a new warning was added in that case while confirming the SD detach.

 - [BZ 1667019](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1667019) **Button for removing cluster can be mistaken for button removing VMs**

   Feature: Moved the Cluster's Remove Button to the drop down menu.



Reason: Enhanced usability.



Result: The remove button resides within the drop down menu to avoid removing the Cluster accidentally.

 - [BZ 1819260](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1819260) **[RFE] enhance search filter for Storage Domains with free argument**

   The following search filter properties for Storage Domains have been enhanced: 

- 'size' changed to 'free_size'

- 'total_size' added to the search engine options

- 'used' changed to 'used_size'



For example , you can use now the following in the Storage Domains tab:



"free_size > 6 GB and total_size < 20 GB"


#### oVirt dependencies

 - [BZ 1860309](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1860309) **Upgrade to GWT 2.9.0**

   Feature: 

Upgrade GWT (Google Web Toolkit) version from 2.8.0 to 2.9.0



Reason: 

1. support for building with Java 11

2. accumulated improvements and bug fixes (from versions 2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.9.0)


### Known Issue

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1837864](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1837864) **Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**

   When upgrading from Red Hat Virtualization 4.4 GA (RHV 4.4.1) to RHEV 4.4.2, the host enters emergency mode and cannot be restarted. 

Workaround: see the solution in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5428651


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1837864](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1837864) **Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**

   When upgrading from Red Hat Virtualization 4.4 GA (RHV 4.4.1) to RHEV 4.4.2, the host enters emergency mode and cannot be restarted. 

Workaround: see the solution in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5428651


#### imgbased

 - [BZ 1837864](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1837864) **Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**

   When upgrading from Red Hat Virtualization 4.4 GA (RHV 4.4.1) to RHEV 4.4.2, the host enters emergency mode and cannot be restarted. 

Workaround: see the solution in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5428651


#### oVirt Node NG Image

 - [BZ 1850378](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1850378) **Installation of node will not quit when mountpoint has existing domain (VMs)**

   When you upgrade Red Hat Virtualization from 4.3 to 4.4 with a storage domain that is locally mounted on / (root), the upgrade fails. Specifically, on the host it appears that the upgrade is successful, but the host's status on the Administration Portal, is `NonOperational`.



Local storage should always be defined on a file system that is separate from / (root). Use a separate logical volume or disk, to prevent possible loss of data during upgrades.



If you are using / (root) as the locally mounted storage domain, migrate your data to a separate logical volume or disk prior to upgrading.
