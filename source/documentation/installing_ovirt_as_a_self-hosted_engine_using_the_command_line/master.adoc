= Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a self-hosted engine using the command line
:context: SHE_cli_deploy
:SHE_cli_deploy:


Self-hosted engine installation is automated using Ansible. The installation script (`hosted-engine --deploy`) runs on an initial deployment host, and the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} (or "engine") is installed and configured on a virtual machine that is created on the deployment host. The {engine-name} and Data Warehouse databases are installed on the {engine-name} virtual machine, but can be migrated to a separate server post-installation if required.

Hosts that can run the {engine-name} virtual machine are referred to as self-hosted engine nodes. At least two self-hosted engine nodes are required to support the high availability feature.

A storage domain dedicated to the {engine-name} virtual machine is referred to as the self-hosted engine storage domain. This storage domain is created by the installation script, so the underlying storage must be prepared before beginning the installation.

See the link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}planning_and_prerequisites_guide/index[_Planning and Prerequisites Guide_] for information on environment options and recommended configuration. See link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}planning_and_prerequisites_guide/index#self-hosted-engine-recommendations[Self-Hosted Engine Recommendations] for configuration specific to a self-hosted engine environment.

== Installation Overview

The self-hosted engine installation uses Ansible and the {engine-appliance-name} (a pre-configured {engine-name} virtual machine image) to automate the following tasks:

* Configuring the first self-hosted engine node
* Installing a {enterprise-linux} virtual machine on that node
* Installing and configuring the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} on that virtual machine
* Configuring the self-hosted engine storage domain

include::common/install/snip-rhvm-appliance-note.adoc[]

Installing a self-hosted engine environment involves the following steps:

. xref:Preparing_Storage_for_RHV_SHE_cli_deploy[Prepare storage to use for the self-hosted engine storage domain and for standard storage domains.] You can use one of the following storage types:
* xref:Preparing_NFS_Storage_SHE_cli_deploy[NFS]
* xref:Preparing_iSCSI_Storage_SHE_cli_deploy[iSCSI]
* xref:Preparing_FCP_Storage_SHE_cli_deploy[Fibre Channel (FCP)]
* xref:Preparing_Red_Hat_Gluster_Storage_SHE_cli_deploy[{gluster-storage-fullname}]

. xref:Installing_the_self-hosted_engine_deployment_host_SHE_cli_deploy[Install a deployment host to run the installation on.] This host will become the first self-hosted engine node. You can use either host type:
* xref:Installing_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SHE_deployment_host[{hypervisor-fullname}]
* xref:Installing_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_Hosts_SHE_deployment_host[{enterprise-linux}]

. xref:Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SHE_cli_deploy[Add more self-hosted engine nodes and standard hosts to the {engine-name}.] Self-hosted engine nodes can run the {engine-name} virtual machine and other virtual machines. Standard hosts can run all other virtual machines, but not the {engine-name} virtual machine.
.. Use either host type, or both:
* xref:Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SHE_cli_deploy[{hypervisor-fullname}]
* xref:Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_hosts_SHE_cli_deploy[{enterprise-linux}]
.. xref:Adding_self-hosted_engine_nodes_to_the_Manager_SHE_cli_deploy[Add hosts to the {engine-name} as self-hosted engine nodes.]
.. xref:Adding_standard_hosts_to_the_Manager_SHE_cli_deploy[Add hosts to the {engine-name} as standard hosts.]

. xref:Adding_Storage_Domains_to_RHV_SHE_cli_deploy[Add more storage domains to the {engine-name}.] The self-hosted engine storage domain is not recommended for use by anything other than the {engine-name} virtual machine.

. If you want to host any databases or services on a server separate from the {engine-name}, xref:Migrating_to_remote_servers_SHE_cli_deploy[you can migrate them after the installation is complete.]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keep the environment up to date. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2974891[] for more information. Since bug fixes for known issues are frequently released, use scheduled tasks to update the hosts and the {engine-name}.

== Migrating Databases and Services to a Remote Server

Although you cannot configure remote databases and services during the automated installation, you can migrate them to a separate server post-installation.

=== Migrating the Data Warehouse to a Separate Machine

This section describes how to migrate the Data Warehouse database and service from the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} machine to a separate machine. Hosting the Data Warehouse service on a separate machine reduces the load on each individual machine, and avoids potential conflicts caused by sharing CPU and memory resources with other processes.

[NOTE]
====
{org-fullname} only supports installing the Data Warehouse database, the Data Warehouse service and Grafana all on the same machine as each other, even though you can install each of these components on separate machines from each other.
====

You have the following migration options:

* You can migrate the Data Warehouse service away from the {engine-name} machine and connect it with the existing Data Warehouse database (`ovirt_engine_history`).
* You can migrate the Data Warehouse database away from the {engine-name} machine and then migrate the Data Warehouse service.
