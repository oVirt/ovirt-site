= Removing a Host from a Self-Hosted Engine Environment

To remove a self-hosted engine node from your environment, place the node into maintenance mode, undeploy the node, and optionally remove it. The node can be managed as a regular host after the HA services have been stopped, and the self-hosted engine configuration files have been removed.


*Removing a Host from a Self-Hosted Engine Environment*

. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts] and select the self-hosted engine node.
. Click menu:Management[Maintenance] and click btn:[OK].
. Click menu:Installation[Reinstall].
. Click the *Hosted Engine* tab and select *UNDEPLOY* from the drop-down list. This action stops the `ovirt-ha-agent` and `ovirt-ha-broker` services and removes the self-hosted engine configuration file.
. Click btn:[OK].
. Optionally, click btn:[Remove] to open the *Remove Host(s)* confirmation window and click btn:[OK].
