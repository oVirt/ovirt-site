On the first weekend of February I've had the pleasure of attending DevConf.CZ 2016, which took place in the wonderful city of Brno, CZ.
It's a relaxed, young and vibrant conference and it was fun and rewarding from my perspective.
Here's a disorganized personal summary:

- Met many community members from all over Europe.
- Attended a presentation on a research to understand theoretical best possible improvements to migration convergence performance[3]. I hope to see some of it in coming versions of QEMU, while we work on other improvements to this critical feature.
- Attended a presentation on the status of ARM on Fedora and CentOS[14]. Seems like a great positive effort, but the road is still long for complete support. Would be cool to support ARM based hosts running virtual machines!
- Attended a presentation on native vs. threads implementation performance in QEMU[4]. The results were not conclusive, though some improvements in native brought it close to or better in some cases to threads. Seems that our default of heuristic for threads in file-based storage and native in block based storage is fine for the time being, but we'll watch closely for developments in this area.
- Attended a presentation on debugging qemu (mainly) in OpenStack[5] - I think (and asked) if libvirt can do a better job - in saving in a cyclic log the QMP commands sent and the response from the guest and dump it in case of a guest crash.
- Attended a Cockpit hackfest[9] - as we intend to use Cockpit as our UI for oVirt Next Generation Node, it was great to present our use case and exchange thoughts, ideas and directions. Few bugs were filed during the hackfest per our comments.
- Attended 'Dockerizing JBoss Applications' presentation[10]. Great work done by the JBoss team to improve and streamline packaging of JBoss into containers.
- Attended 'Fedora Upstream Testing' presentation[13]. I discussed with the presenter the possibility to run oVirt with Lago[17] in Fedora, in a CI way, by monitoring distgit changes for relevant packages (such as lvm2, device-mapper*, libvirt and others.
- Attended 'High Performance VMs in OpenStack'[12] - looks like oVirt is already doing a lot of what OpenStack are working to achieve high-performance from KVM!
- Preached on running Lago with OpenStack, Gluster and Cockpit. At least the first two items look really promising and I'm looking forward to a collaboration in those efforts. I might just try to do the Gluster one myself.
- Having used the oVirt Live[18] USB DoK image in both FOSDEM and DevConf, I've found several items where we can improve in and filed relevant RFEs for them[15][16].

- The oVirt team has delivered numerous presentations in the virtualization track[1][2][6] - and the Gluster team has additionally provided more presentations[7][8], which were all well received.

I'd like to thank our project's community managers Mikey and Brian for once again, just one week after FOSDEM, leading the effort of representing the oVirt project and community in this event.

Happy to hear any feedback,
