# Bridgeless Node Networking

## Current status

*   Status: **In Progress**

## Detailed Description

Up to now the topology looked like:

    Node - Bridge - (Tagged) Nic

In future it can also be:

    Node - (Tagged) Nic

## Benefit to oVirt

Some consumers of oVirt Node don't require the bridge or even conflict with an existing bridge on the system By removing this (up to now) mandatory bridge, we open up Node to more consumers.
