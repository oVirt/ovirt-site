# Outreachy

oVirt is pleased to announce it will be participating in the December-March round of [Outreachy](//www.gnome.org/outreachy/), organized by the [GNOME Foundation](//www.gnome.org/foundation/), [Software Freedom Conservancy](//sfconservancy.org/), and [Red Hat](//redhat.com).

Outreachy helps people from groups underrepresented in free and open source software get involved. We provide a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.

## Information for Participants

oVirt, with the help of sponsors, will sponsor internships from December 6 2016 to March 6, 2017.

Because the program is intended to help newcomers and contributors who are relatively new to the FOSS community to get more involved, Outreachy unfortunately can't accept past participants of Outreach Program for Women, Outreachy, or Google Summer of Code internships. However, if you qualify for Google Summer of Code, you are more than welcome to apply for it.

The internship is expected to be a full-time effort, meaning that the participants must be able to spend 40 hours a week on their project. Participants will work remotely from home. Because IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is one of the primary means of communication within oVirt, participants should be present on oVirt's IRC (#ovirt @ OFTC) channel while working. You will also be expected to communicate electronically with other project members via other means, including Bugzilla bug tracker comments, mailing list discussion, blog posts, and personal e-mail. Participants will be expected to blog at least once every two weeks about their work and their blog posts will be included on the site that publishes oVirt blog posts, currently [community.redhat.com](//community.redhat.com).

For information how to apply follow the instructions on [Outreachy](//www.gnome.org/outreachy/).

## Information for Mentors

1.  Read the [information for mentors](//wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/Admin/InfoForMentors) to be familiar with the expectations for the application process, contracts, and mentoring during the internships.
2.  Send a brief e-mail with an introduction and a subject starting with [INTRODUCTION] to outreachy-list@gnome.org - Outreachy will subscribe you to the list and everyone will know who you are! This is a private list for organizations' coordinators and mentors, where prospective applicants can send their inquiries and applications. Outreachy will also subscribe you to the announce list, which is a low-traffic list with important coordination e-mails. While the main list can get busy at times and you are only asked to follow up on e-mails reflecting interest in your organization in the subject, Outreachy asks you to keep a close eye on the e-mails sent to the announce list.
3.  Sign up as a mentor in the [online application system](//outreachy.gnome.org/) by following the guide for it.
4.  Start hanging out in #outreachy and #outreachy-admin on GIMPNet (irc.gnome.org).
5.  You are welcome to pitch in answering any questions from prospective applicants on the mailing list and the IRC channel.
6.  At any time, please [send Outreachy](//wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Outreachy/Admin?action=show&redirect=OutreachProgramForWomen%2FAdmin#Contact) any feedback about the program, any questions or concerns.
