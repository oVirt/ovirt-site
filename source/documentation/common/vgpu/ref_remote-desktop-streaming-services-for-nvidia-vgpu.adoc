= Remote desktop streaming services for NVIDIA vGPU

The following remote desktop streaming services have been successfully tested for use with the NVIDIA vGPU feature in RHEL 8:

* HP-RGS
* Mechdyne TGX - It is currently not possible to use Mechdyne TGX with Windows Server 2016 guests.
* NICE DCV - When using this streaming service, use fixed resolution settings, because using dynamic resolution in some cases results in a black screen.
