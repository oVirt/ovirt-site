= Directory Server Support

During installation, {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} creates a default *admin* user in a default *internal* domain. This account is intended for use when initially configuring the environment, and for troubleshooting. You can create additional users on the *internal* domain using `ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool`. User accounts created on local domains are known as local users. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#sect-administering_user_tasks_from_the_commandline[Administering User Tasks From the Command Line] in the _Administration Guide_.

You can also attach an external directory server to your {virt-product-fullname} environment and use it as an external domain. User accounts created on external domains are known as directory users. Attachment of more than one directory server to the {engine-name} is also supported.

The following directory servers are supported for use with {virt-product-fullname}. For more detailed information on installing and configuring a supported directory server, see the vendor's documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A user with permissions to read all users and groups must be created in the directory server specifically for use as the {virt-product-fullname} administrative user. Do *not* use the administrative user for the directory server as the {virt-product-fullname} administrative user.
