# oVirt Node

## Installing oVirt Node

oVirt Node is a minimal operating system based on CentOS that is designed to provide a simple method for setting up a
physical machine to act as a hypervisor in an oVirt environment. The minimal operating system contains only the packages
required for the machine to act as a hypervisor, and features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host and
performing administrative tasks. See [http://cockpit-project.org/running.html](http://cockpit-project.org/running.html)
for the minimum browser requirements.

See [Chapter 6: oVirt Nodes](/documentation/install-guide/chap-oVirt_Nodes.html) in the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/)
for installation instructions.

Also see [Chapter 5: Introduction to Hosts](/documentation/install-guide/chap-Introduction_to_Hosts.html) and
[Chapter 7: Enterprise Linux Hosts](/documentation/install-guide/chap-Enterprise_Linux_Hosts.html)

Installing oVirt Node on a physical machine involves three key steps:

 * Download the oVirt Node Installation ISO below (probably [oVirt Node 4.3 - Stable Release - Installation ISO](https://www.ovirt.org/download/node.html#ovirt-node-43---stable-release))

 * Write the oVirt Node Installation ISO disk image to a USB, CD, or DVD, preferably using `dd`.

 * Boot your physical machine from that media and install the oVirt Node minimal operating system.

## oVirt Node 4.3 - Stable Release

This is the oVirt Node 4.3 image including the latest oVirt 4.3 packages. This is the latest stable release.
