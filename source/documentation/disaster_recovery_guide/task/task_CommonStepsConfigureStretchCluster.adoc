See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#SPM_Priority[SPM Priority] in the _Administration Guide_.

. Configure all virtual machines that must failover as highly available, and ensure that the virtual machine has a lease on the target storage domain. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#Configuring_a_highly_available_virtual_machine[Configuring a Highly Available Virtual Machine] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.

. Configure virtual machine to host soft affinity and define the behavior you expect from the affinity group. See  link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#sect-Affinity_Groups[Affinity Groups] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_ and link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#sect-Scheduling_Policies[Scheduling Policies] in the _Administration Guide_.
