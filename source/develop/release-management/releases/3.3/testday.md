*   improve the quality of oVirt.
*   Introduce and validating new oVirt 3.3 features

### What I should do

*   If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer information detail section below
*   Update the Participants section.
*   Go a head and [install ovirt](/develop/release-management/releases/3.3/testday/#installation-notes)
*   Accomplish the goals set in objective section , run the tests, update the test matrix.
*   Running into any issues - [Try to get answer](/community/) or [open a BZ](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt)

### Installation notes

*   make sure you have either a fedora 19 or centos 6.4 machine installed.
*   install the release pkg:

`sudo yum localinstall `[`http://ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release.noarch.rpm`](/releases/ovirt-release.noarch.rpm)

*   make sure to enable the [ovirt-beta] & [ovirt-stable] repos and disable the [ovirt-nightly] repo.
*   if you're using centos, make sure you have epel repo enabled as well:

      [epel]
      name=Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 6 - $basearch
      mirrorlist=`[`https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=epel-6&arch`](https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=epel-6&arch)`=$basearch
      enabled=1
      gpgcheck=0

*   install & run setup

      sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine
      sudo engine-setup

*   for more info, checkout [install oVirt](/download/)

#### Known issues

##### host installation

Fedora 19: If the ovirtmgmt bridge is not successfully installed during initial host-setup, manually click on the host, setup networks, and add the ovirtmgmt bridge. It is recommended to disable NetworkManager as well.

#### Network

*   Important Note: Known Fedora 19 bug: If the ovirtmgmt bridge is not successfully installed during initial host-setup, manually click on the host, setup networks, and add the ovirtmgmt bridge.
*   Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*   Advanced configurations:

![](/images/wiki/Vlan_bonding.png) make sure each of the configs can:

*   survive a reboot
*   test network at both host and VM level
*   ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*   remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

Bugs found:

*   Bug 906289 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Non-VM networks shown as VM networks on cluster attachment dialog
*   Bug 906291 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Non-VM networks not being detached from cluster
*   Bug 906313 - [oVirt-webadmin] [setupNetworks] "No valid Operation for <network_name> and Unassigned Logical Networks panel"
*   Bug 906383 - [vdsm] [setupNetworks] Error while attaching non-VM network to interface on Fedora 18
*   Bug 906393 - [oVirt] [network] Audit log message for unmanaged network
*   Bug 906394 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Loading animation in network main tab 'hosts' and 'vms' subtab is stuck on first view of the sub tab
*   Bug 906405 - Bad Error Message when Removing vNic from Running VM
*   Bug 906434 - Editing vnic's type and mac are blocked when the vnic was unplugged and updated to plugged
*   Bug 906440 - Updating type of a plugged nic should be blocked on the ui side

#### Tools

*   Basic operations on iso-uploader:

1.  **engine-iso-uploader list**
2.  **engine-iso-uploader upload <iso> -i <iso-domain-name> -v -f**

*   Basic operations on log-collector:

1.  **engine-log-collector list**
2.  **engine-log-collector collect**

*   Basic operation on image-uploader

**engine-image-uploader --name=<new name here> -e <domain> upload my.ovf**

##### New to v3.1:

*   port mirroring: one can setup a VM that sniffs all IP traffic between VMs on a network on a host.
*   no mac spoofing: VMs cannot emit packets with spoofed mac address (unless specifically allowed to).
*   Sync network: change network MTU (or other property) on host, verify that Engine may overwrite it with Sync network
*   Jumbo packets: see if can be configured and used by storage

##### New to v3.2:

*   Network main tab operational: you can search hosts and VM based on their network connectivity
*   Guest agent reported devices: install guest agent on a VM and see it report internal information of the vNics (internal device name, IPv4 and IPv6)
*   Network Linking: allow changing network the VM is connect to while it is running
