. Click the *Host Devices* tab to list the host devices attached to the virtual machine.
. Select the host device to detach from the virtual machine, or hold `Ctrl` to select multiple devices, and click btn:[Remove device]. This opens the *Remove Host Device(s)* window.
. Click btn:[OK] to confirm and detach these devices from the virtual machine.
