# oVirt 3.6.3 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.6.3 release
as of March 1st, 2016.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization. This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, CentOS Linux 6.7 (or similar) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2, CentOS Linux 7.2 (or similar).

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases,
check out the [previous versions release notes](http://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/releases/).
For a general overview of oVirt, read [the Quick Start Guide](Quick_Start_Guide)
and the [about oVirt](about oVirt) page.

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`# yum localinstall `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm)

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release35 package already installed on your system. You can then install ovirt-release36.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

Once ovirt-release36 package is installed, you will have the ovirt-3.6-stable repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.

If you're installing oVirt 3.6.3 on a clean host, you should read our
[Quick Start Guide](Quick Start Guide).

If you are upgrading from oVirt < 3.5.0, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.5.0 or later. Please see [oVirt 3.5.6 Release Notes](oVirt 3.5.6 Release Notes) for upgrade instructions.

For upgrading now you just need to execute:

      # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
      # engine-setup

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install) guide.

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine) guide.

### oVirt Live

A new oVirt Live ISO is available at:

[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-live/`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-live/)

## What's New in 3.6.3?

<b>WebSocketProxy vdcoption requires a restart to become effective</b>

The WebSocketProxy VDC option(and a few others) can now be updated without need to restart the engine.
Here are the steps to reload the configuration on-the-fly:
* set: engine-config -s WebSocketProxy=NEW_VALUE
*   refresh cache via REST API POST call, i.e.:

      curl --silent --insecure --request POST --header "Accept: application/xml" --header "Content-Type: application/xml" --user "admin@internal:PWD" "http://localhost:8080/ovirt-engine/api/reloadconfigurations" --data '<action/>'

*   refresh GUI: Ctrl+R

Please note that support for reloading VDC options on-the-fly will be most probably dropped in oVirt 4.0.

<b>OVIRT-CLI now use remote-viewer instead of spicec for spice based console</b>
 
<b>unassigned host status now reflects more the real status</b>

The new status value of the host when it is being activated will be changed from 'Maintenance' to 'Activating' (used to be 'Unassigned')

<b>Disable cloud-init service after appliance deployment</b>

cloud-init services are now disabled on the engine-appliance after the initial deployment in order to speed up subsequent boots.
Updated windows-guest-tools iso with updated virtio-win drivers 0.1.112-1.
