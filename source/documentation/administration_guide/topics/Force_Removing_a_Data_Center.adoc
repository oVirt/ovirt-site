==== Force Removing a Data Center

A data center becomes `Non Responsive` if the attached storage domain is corrupt or if the host becomes `Non Responsive`. You cannot *Remove* the data center under either circumstance.

*Force Remove* does not require an active host. It also permanently removes the attached storage domain.

It may be necessary to *Destroy* a corrupted storage domain before you can *Force Remove* the data center.
