# Detaching Virtual Machines from a Virtual Machine Pool

You can detach virtual machines from a virtual machine pool. Detaching a virtual machine removes it from the pool to become an independent virtual machine.

**Detaching Virtual Machines from a Virtual Machine Pool**

1. Use the **Pools** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the virtual machine pool in the results list.

2. Ensure the virtual machine has a status of `Down` because you cannot detach a running virtual machine.

    Click the **Virtual Machines** tab in the details pane to list the virtual machines in the pool. 

3. Select one or more virtual machines and click **Detach** to open the **Detach Virtual Machine(s)** confirmation window.

4. Click **OK** to detach the virtual machine from the pool.

**Note:** The virtual machine still exists in the environment and can be viewed and accessed from the **Virtual Machines** resource tab. Note that the icon changes to denote that the detached virtual machine is an independent virtual machine.

You have detached a virtual machine from the virtual machine pool.
