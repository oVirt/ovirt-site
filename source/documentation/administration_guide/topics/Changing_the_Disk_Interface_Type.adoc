==== Changing the Disk Interface Type

Users can change a disk's interface type after the disk has been created. This enables you to attach an existing disk to a virtual machine that requires a different interface type. For example, a disk using the `VirtIO` interface can be attached to a virtual machine requiring the `VirtIO-SCSI` or `IDE` interface. This provides flexibility to migrate disks for the purpose of backup and restore, or disaster recovery. The disk interface for shareable disks can also be updated per virtual machine. This means that each virtual machine that uses the shared disk can use a different interface type.

To update a disk interface type, all virtual machines using the disk must first be stopped.
