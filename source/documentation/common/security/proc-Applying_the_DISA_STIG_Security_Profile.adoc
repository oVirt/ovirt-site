= Applying the DISA STIG for Red Hat Linux 7 Profile

This topic shows you how to enable the _DISA STIG for Red Hat Linux 7_ security profile while installing the {virt-product-fullname} (RHV) {engine-name} ("the {engine-name}"), the {hypervisor-fullname} ({hypervisor-shortname}), and the {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}.

.Enable DISA STIG for Red Hat Linux 7 for {hypervisor-shortname}

The following procedure applies to installing {hypervisor-fullname} ({hypervisor-shortname}) for two different purposes:

* Using {hypervisor-shortname} as the host for the {engine-name} virtual machine when you deploy the {engine-name} as a self-hosted engine.
* Using {hypervisor-shortname} as an ordinary host in an RHV cluster.

If you use the Anaconda installer to install {hypervisor-shortname}:

. On the *Installation Summary* screen, select *Security Policy*.

. On the *Security Policy* screen that opens, toggle the *Apply security policy* setting to *On*.

. Scroll down the list of profiles and select *DISA STIG for Red Hat Linux 7*.

. Click the *Select profile* button. This action adds a green checkmark next to the profile and adds packages to the list of *Changes that were done or need to be done*.
[NOTE]
These packages are already part of the {hypervisor-shortname} image. {hypervisor-shortname} ships as a single system image. Installation of packages required by any other selected security profiles which are not part of the {hypervisor-shortname} image may not be possible. Please see the {hypervisor-shortname} package manifest for a list of included packages.

. Click *Done*.

. On the *Installation Summary* screen, verify that the status of *Security Policy* is *Everything okay*.

. Later, when you log into {hypervisor-shortname}, the command line displays the following information.

[NOTE]
If you link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/index[deploy RHV as a Self-Hosted Engine using the command line], during the series of prompts after you enter `ovirt-hosted-engine-setup`, the command line will ask `Do you want to apply a default OpenSCAP security profile?` Enter `Yes` and follow the instructions to select the _DISA STIG for Red Hat Linux 7_ profile.
