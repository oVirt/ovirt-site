= Configuring Host Firewall Rules

You can configure the host firewall rules so that they are persistent, using Ansible. The cluster must be configured to use `firewalld`.

.Configuring Firewall Rules for Hosts

. On the {engine-name} machine, edit *ovirt-host-deploy-post-tasks.yml.example* to add a custom firewall port:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# vi /etc/ovirt-engine/ansible/ovirt-host-deploy-post-tasks.yml.example
---
#
# Any additional tasks required to be executing during host deploy process can
# be added below
#
- name: Enable additional port on firewalld
  firewalld:
    port: "_12345/tcp_"
    permanent: yes
    immediate: yes
    state: enabled
----

. Save the file to another location as *ovirt-host-deploy-post-tasks.yml*.

New or reinstalled hosts are configured with the updated firewall rules.

Existing hosts must be reinstalled by clicking menu:Installation[Reinstall] and selecting *Automatically configure host firewall*.
