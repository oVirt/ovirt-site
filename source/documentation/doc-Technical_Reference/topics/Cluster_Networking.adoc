A data center is a logical grouping of multiple clusters and each cluster is a logical group of multiple hosts. xref:figu-Technical_Reference_Guide-Networking_in_Data_Centers_and_Clusters.-Networking_within_a_cluster[Networking within a cluster] depicts the contents of a single cluster.

Hosts in a cluster all have access to the same storage domains. Hosts in a cluster also have logical networks applied to the cluster. For a virtual machine logical network to become operational for use with virtual machines, the network must be defined and implemented for each host in the cluster using the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. Other logical network types can be implemented on only the hosts that use them.

Multi-host network configuration automatically applies any updated network settings to all of the hosts within the data center to which the network is assigned.
