# Chapter 2: Analyzing Metrics

Kibana offers two ways of analyzing metrics:

* Build your own visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables.

* Load and use predefined sets of visualizations

The oVirt Project suggests that you start off by using the predefined visualizations. Each set is known as a _dashboard_. Dashboards have the advantage of enabling you to quickly access a wide range of metrics while offering the flexibility of changing them to match your individual needs.

# Using Dashboards

A dashboard displays a set of saved visualizations. Dashboards have the advantage of enabling you to quickly access a wide range of metrics while offering the flexibility of changing them to match your individual needs.

You can use the **Dashboard** tab to create your own dashboards. Alternatively, Red Hat provides the following dashboard examples, which you can import into Kibana and use as is or customize to suit your specific needs:

* System dashboard

* Hosts dashboard

* VMs dashboard

**Importing Dashboard Examples**

1. Copy the `/etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/dashboards-examples` directory from the Engine virtual machine to your local machine.

2. Open Kibana and click the **Settings** tab.

3. Click the **Indices** tab.

4. Select the **Index Patterns** that start with `project.*` in the **Index Patterns** pane and click the **Refresh field list** ![](/images/metrics-user-guide/refresh.png) button.

5. Do step #4 for each relevant index pattern.

6. Click the **Objects** tab.

7. Click **Import** and import **Searches** from your local copy of `/etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/dashboards-examples`.

**NOTE** Admin user will be notofied to choose the relevant **Index Patterns** for the imported searches. Choose `project.*`.

8. Click **Import** and import **Visualizations**.

**NOTE** Admin user will be notofied to choose the relevant **Index Patterns** for the imported searches. Choose `project.*`.

**If you see an error message while importing the visualizations, check your hosts to ensure that Collectd and Fluentd are running without errors.**

9. Click **Import** and import **Dashboards**.

   The imported dashboards are now stored in the system.

**Loading Saved Dashboards**

Once you have created and saved a dashboard, or imported Red Hat's sample dashboards, you can display them in the *Dashboard* tab:

1. Click the **Dashboard** tab.

2. Click the **Load Saved Dashboard** ![](/images/metrics-user-guide/loadSavedDashboard.png) button to display a list of saved dashboards.

3. Click a saved dashboard to load it.

## Creating a New Visualization

Use the **Visualize** page to design data visualizations based on the metrics or log data collected by Metrics Store.
You can save these visualizations, use them individually, or combine visualizations into a dashboard.
A visualization can be based on one of the following data source types:

* A new interactive search

* A saved search

* An existing saved visualization

Visualizations are based on Elasticsearch's [aggregation feature](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-aggregations.html).

**Creating a New Visualization**

Kibana guides you through the creation process with the help of a visualization wizard.

1. To start the new visualization wizard, click the **Visualize** tab.

2. In step 1, **Create a new visualization table**, select the type of visualization you want to create.

3. In step 2, **Select a search source**, select whether you want to create a new search or reuse a saved search:

   * To create a new search, select **From a new search** and enter the indexes to use as the source. Use *project.ovirt-logs* prefix for log data or *project.ovirt-metrics* prefix for metric data.

   * To create a visualization from a saved search, select **From a saved search** and enter the name of the search.

     The visualization editor appears.

## Graphic User Interface Elements

The visualization editor consists of three main areas:

* ![](/images/metrics-user-guide/1.png) The toolbar

* ![](/images/metrics-user-guide/2.png) The aggregation builder

* ![](/images/metrics-user-guide/3.png) The preview pane

**Visualization Editor**

![visualization editor screenshot](/images/metrics-user-guide/visualize.png)

## Using the Visualization Editor

Use the visualization editor to create visualizations by:

* Submitting search queries from the toolbar

* Selecting metrics and aggregations from the aggregation builder

### Submitting Search Queries

Use the toolbar to perform search queries based on the Lucene query parser syntax. For a detailed explanation of this syntax, see [Apache Lucene - Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).

### Selecting Metrics and Aggregations

Use the aggregation builder to define which metrics to display, how to aggregate the data, and how to group the results.

The aggregation builder performs two types of aggregations, metric and bucket, which differ depending on the type of visualization you are creating:

* Bar, line, or area chart visualizations use **metrics** for the y-axis and **buckets** for the x-axis, segment bar colors, and row/column splits.

* Pie charts use **metrics** for the slice size and **buckets** to define the number of slices.

**To define a visualization from the aggregation bar:**

1. Select the metric aggregation for your visualization’s y-axis from the **Aggregation** drop-down list in the **metrics** section, for example, count, average, sum, min, max, or unique count. For more information about how these aggregations are calculated, see [Metrics Aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3//search-aggregations-metrics.html) in the Elasticsearch Reference documentation.

2. Use the **buckets** area to select the aggregations for the visualization’s x-axis, color slices, and row/column splits:

   i. Use the **Aggregation** drop-down list to define how to aggregate the bucket. Common bucket aggregations include date histogram, range, terms, filters, and significant terms.

      **Note:** The order in which you define the buckets determines the order in which they will be executed, so the first aggregation determines the data set for any subsequent aggregations. For more information, see [Aggregation Builder](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/4.5/visualize.html#aggregation-builder) in the Kibana documentation.

   ii. Select the metric you want to display from the **Field** drop-down list. For details about each of the available metrics, see [Metrics Schema](Metrics_Schema).

   iii. Select the required interval from the **Interval** field.

3. Click **Apply Changes** ![](/images/metrics-user-guide/create.png).

## Metrics Schema

The following sections describe the metrics that are available from the *Field* menu when creating visualizations.

    **Note:** All metric values are collected at 10 second intervals.

### Aggregation Metrics

The Aggregation metric aggregates several values into one using aggregation functions such as sum, average, min, and max. It is used to provide a combined value for average and total CPU statistics.

The following table describes the aggregation metrics reported by the **Aggregation** plugin.

<table>

### CPU Load Average Metrics

CPU load represents CPU contention, that is, the average number of schedulable processes at any given time. This is reported as an average value for all CPU cores on the host. Each CPU core can only execute one process at a time. Therefore, a CPU load average above 1.0 indicates that the CPUs have more work than they can perform, and the system is overloaded.

CPU load is reported over short term (last one minute), medium term (last five minutes) and long term (last fifteen minutes). While it is normal for a host's short term load average to exceed 1.0 (for a single CPU), sustained load average above 1.0 on a host may indicate a problem.

On multi-processor systems, the load is relative to the number of processor cores available. The "100% utilization" mark is 1.00 on a single-core, 2.00 on a dual-core, 4.00 on a quad-core system.

The oVirt Project recommends looking at CPU load in conjunction with CPU Metrics.

The following table describes the CPU load metrics reported by the **Load** plugin.

**CPU Load Average Metrics**

| Metric Name | Description |
|-
| collectd.load.load.longterm |Average number of schedulable processes per CPU core over the last 15 minutes. A value above 1.0 indicates the system was overloaded during the last 15 minutes. |

### Swap Metrics

Swap metrics enable you to view the amount of memory currently written onto the hard disk, in bytes, according to available, used, and cached swap space.

The following table describes the Swap metrics reported by the **Swap** plugin.

**Swap Metrics**

|Metric Name |collectd.type |collectd.type_instance|collectd.dstypes |Description|
|-
|collectd.swap.swap |swap |used / free /  cached|Gauge|The used, available, and cached swap space (in bytes). |
|collectd.swap.swap_io|swap_io |in / out |[Derive](Derive) |The number of swap pages written and read per second.\
|collectd.swap.percent|percent |used / free / cached |Gauge |The percentage of used, available, and cached swap space.|

**Additional Fields**

### Gauge and Derive Data Source Types

Each metric includes a *collectd.dstypes* value that defines the data source's type:

* **Gauge**: A gauge value is simply stored as-is and is used for values that may increase or decrease, such as the amount of memory used.

* **Derive**: These data sources assume that the change of the value is interesting, i.e., the derivative. Such data sources are very common for events that can be counted, for example the number of disk read operations. The total number of disk read operations is not interesting, but rather the change since the value was last read. The value is therefore converted to a rate using the following formula:


        rate = value(new)-value(old)\
                time(new)-time(old)

    **Note:** If value(new) is less than value (old), the resulting rate will be negative. If the minimum value to zero, such data points will be discarded.

## Working with Metrics Store Indexes

Metrics Store creates the following two indexes per day:

* project.ovirt-metrics-&lt;ovirt-env-name>.uuid.yyyy.mm.dd

* project.ovirt-logs-&lt;ovirt-env-name>.uuid.yyyy.mm.dd

When using the **Discover** page, select the index named project.ovirt-logs-&lt;ovirt-env-name>.uuid.

In the **Visualization** page select project.ovirt-metrics-&lt;ovirt-env-name>.uuid for metrics data or project.ovirt-logs-&lt;ovirt-env-name>.uuid for log data.
