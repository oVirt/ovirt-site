=== Load Balancing Policy: Cluster_Maintenance

A cluster maintenance scheduling policy limits activity in a cluster during maintenance tasks.
When a cluster maintenance policy is set:

* No new virtual machines may be started, except highly available virtual machines. (Users can create highly available virtual machines and start them manually.)

* In the event of host failure, highly available virtual machines will restart properly and any virtual machine can migrate.
