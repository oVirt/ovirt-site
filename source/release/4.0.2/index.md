# oVirt 4.0.2 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 4.0.2 Release as of August 12th, 2016.
The release has been updated on August 19th with a new build of oVirt Engine fixing [BZ 1367483](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1367483)

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization. This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2, CentOS Linux 7.2 (or similar).

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases,
check out the [previous versions release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/).

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm)

If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
      # engine-setup

Upgrade on Fedora 22 and Enterprise Linux 6 is not supported and you should follow our [Migration Guide](../../documentation/migration-engine-36-to-40/) in order to migrate to Enterprise Linux 7 or Fedora 23.

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install) guide.

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine) guide.

## Known issues

 - [BZ 1297835](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1297835) <b>Host install fails on Fedora 23 due to lack of dep on python2-dnf</b><br>On Fedora >= 23 dnf package manager with python 3 is used by default while
ovirt-host-deploy is executed by ovirt-engine using python2. This cause Host install to fail on Fedora >= 23 due to lack of python2-dnf in the default environment. As workaround please install manually python2-dnf on the host before trying to add it to the engine.

## What's New in 4.0.2?

### Enhancement

#### oVirt Engine

##### Team: Infra

 - [BZ 1346782](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1346782) <b>Display also pretty name along with name, version and release in Host Detail tab in Hosts view</b><br>With this release, the Administration Portal displays the operating system pretty name for all hosts that have an /etc/os-release file with the PRETTY_NAME entry. When you select a host, you can see an "OS Description" field in the "Software" section of the "General" sub-tab. This field can be used to tell the difference between Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) and RHEL hosts. Note: this enhancement is not accessible to the REST API.

##### Team: Integration

 - [BZ 1290073](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1290073) <b>engine-setup should warn users running within hosted engine to set to maintenance</b><br>Feature: <br>Warn users to set system into global maintenance mode before running engine-setup. <br><br>Reason: <br>Data corruption may occur if the engine-setup is run without setting the system into global maintenance.<br><br>Result: <br>The user is warned and the setup will be aborted if the system is not in the global maintenance mode, if the engine is running in the hosted engine configuration.

##### Team: Network

 - [BZ 1209795](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1209795) <b>[RFE] alert after a VM is imported while using MAC outside its MAC Pool</b><br>Feature: <br>The system will alert upon importing a VM with a MAC, which is out of the range of the target MAC-pool range.<br><br>Reason: <br>Having such MAC could indicate the problem of MAC collision in the user's LAN. Such problem could appear immediately or later, when 2 active NICs with the same problematic MAC would appear in the user's LAN: one on the imported VM and another one on any other network appliance that isn't managed by the this oVirt instance.<br><br>Result:

##### Team: UX

 - [BZ 1358136](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1358136) <b>[LOGGING] /var/log/ovirt-engine/ui.log is growing at a rate of 16mb/second</b><br>This update prevents UI exceptions from repeatedly spamming the remote /var/log/ovirt-engine/ui.log after subsequent occurrences of the same error. Each remote operation is an HTTP request and consumes network resources.<br><br>Any uncaught exception in the Administration Portal or User Portal is compared to the last one, and only logged remotely if it's not the same. All occurrences are still logged on the web browser.
 - [BZ 1361255](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1361255) <b>UI plugin API: allow executing certain actions while the plugin is loading</b><br>Background:<br><br>UI plugin API performs requested actions only if the given plugin is either initializing (within UiInit callback) or in use (within other callbacks).<br><br>This means all API actions are no-op while the plugin is loading, e.g. before the plugin calls the ready() function that triggers the UiInit callback. <br><br>Feature:<br><br>Allow following API functions to be executed also while the plugin is loading:<br><br>- loginUserName<br>- loginUserId<br>- ssoToken<br>- engineBaseUrl<br>- currentLocale<br><br>Above functions are considered "safe to call while loading" as they have no visual or other side effects on WebAdmin UI.<br><br>Reason:<br><br>Let UI plugins call above functions within their init code, e.g. before the plugin calls ready() to signal that it's ready for use.<br><br>Result:<br><br>Plugins able to call above functions within their init code.

##### Team: Virt

 - [BZ 1285883](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1285883) <b>Align virt-viewer to engine SSO and remove proprietary HTTP session access</b><br>The Virt Viewers .vv file's 'versions=' row requires a remote-viewer that supports the 'sso-token=' row. The minimum versions are:<br>- Windows (64-bit and 32-bit): 2.0-160<br>- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7: 2.0-8<br>- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6: No supporting sso-token planned.
 - [BZ 1348907](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1348907) <b>During cluster level upgrade - warn and mark VMs as pending a configuration change when they are running</b><br>Previously, cluster compatibility version upgrades were blocked if there was a running virtual machine in the cluster. Now, the user is informed about running/suspended virtual machines in a cluster when changing the cluster version. All such virtual machines are marked with a Next Run Configuration symbol to denote the requirement for rebooting them as soon as possible after the cluster version upgrade.
 - [BZ 1356488](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1356488) <b>Edit VM Pool show wrong storage domain</b><br>With this update, a new option been added to the options for a virtual machine pool for disk storage. This option allows the user to select Auto Select Disk Target, instead of a specific domain. This means that every new virtual machine in the pool will use the storage domain with the most available space.
 - [BZ 1310804](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1310804) <b>[RFE] Override instance type on VmPools in Python-SDK</b><br>The instance type field was missing in the REST API virtual machine pool resource. This update adds the ability to pick one when creating the virtual machine pool, and to report the currently configured one.

#### VDSM

##### Team: Gluster

 - [BZ 1225728](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1225728) <b>[RFE][HC] vdsm-gluster to be build as part of RHEV vdsm build</b><br>

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

##### Team: Integration

 - [BZ 1313917](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1313917) <b>[RFE] allow NFS hosted-engine system started on 3.4 to upgrade its filebase metadata and lockspace area to a VDSM volume as for fresh deployments</b><br>This update supports the self-hosted engine upgrade path from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.4 to Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 by migrating filebase metadata and lockspace.

#### oVirt Engine DWH

##### Team: DWH

 - [BZ 1349309](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1349309) <b>Lower interval collection rate (to improve monitoring for System Dashboard)</b><br>The sampling interval default time has been decreased from 1 minute to 20 seconds to provide more accurate calculations for the new dashboards.

#### oVirt Cockpit Plugin

##### Team: Virt

 - [BZ 1358783](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1358783) <b>webadmin-cockpit-ui-plugin: Show instructions how to accept Cockpit's SSL certificate</b><br>This update improves the error message received when Cockpit cannot be displayed in the Administration portal's Host's sub-tab. The error now includes SSL certificate information and a link to the Cockpit ping page.
