==== Turning On a SPICE Proxy

This procedure explains how to activate (or turn on) the SPICE proxy.


*Activating SPICE Proxy*

. On the {engine-name}, use the engine-config tool to set a proxy: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
# `engine-config -s SpiceProxyDefault=someProxy`
----
+
. Restart the `ovirt-engine` service: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl restart ovirt-engine.service
----
+
The proxy must have this form:
+
[source,terminal]
----
protocol://[host]:[port]
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Only SPICE clients shipped with {enterprise-linux} 6.7, {enterprise-linux} 7.2, or later, support HTTPS proxies. Earlier clients only support HTTP. If HTTPS is specified for earlier clients, the client will ignore the proxy setting and attempt a direct connection to the host.
====

SPICE Proxy is now activated (turned on). It is now possible to connect to the {virt-product-fullname} network through the SPICE proxy.
