## Explanation of Settings in the New Virtual Machine and Edit Virtual Machine Windows

### Virtual Machine General Settings Explained

The following table details the options available on the **General** tab of the **New Virtual Machine** and **Edit Virtual Machine** windows.

**Virtual Machine: General Settings**

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>Field Name</td>
   <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Cluster</b></td>
   <td>The name of the host cluster to which the virtual machine is attached. Virtual machines are hosted on any physical machine in that cluster in accordance with policy rules.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Template</b></td>
   <td>
   <p>The template on which the virtual machine is based. This field is set to `Blank` by default, which allows you to create a virtual machine on which an operating system has not yet been installed. Templates are displayed as **Name | Sub-version name (Sub-version number)**. Each new version is displayed with a number in brackets that indicates the relative order of the version, with a higher number indicating a more recent version.</p>
   <p>The version name is displayed as `base version` if it is the root template of the template version chain.</p>
   <p>When the virtual machine is stateless, there is an option to select the `latest` version of the template. This option means that anytime a new version of this template is created, the virtual machine is automatically recreated on restart based on the latest template.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Operating System</b></td>
   <td>The operating system. Valid values include a range of Enterprise Linux and Windows variants.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Instance Type</b></td>
   <td>
    <p>The instance type on which the virtual machine's hardware configuration can be based. This field is set to <b>Custom</b> by default, which means the virtual machine is not connected to an instance type. The other options available from this drop down menu are <b>Large</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Small</b>, <b>Tiny</b>, <b>XLarge</b>, and any custom instance types that the Administrator has created.</p>
    <p>Other settings that have a chain link icon next to them are pre-filled by the selected instance type. If one of these values is changed, the virtual machine will be detached from the instance type and the chain icon will appear broken. However, if the changed setting is restored to its original value, the virtual machine will be reattached to the instance type and the links in the chain icon will rejoin.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Optimized for</b></td>
   <td>The type of system for which the virtual machine is to be optimized. There are two options: <b>Server</b>, and <b>Desktop</b>; by default, the field is set to <b>Server</b>. Virtual machines optimized to act as servers have no sound card, use a cloned disk image, and are not stateless. In contrast, virtual machines optimized to act as desktop machines do have a sound card, use an image (thin allocation), and are stateless.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Name</b></td>
   <td>The name of the virtual machine. The name must be a unique name within the data center and must not contain any spaces, and must contain at least one character from A-Z or 0-9. The maximum length of a virtual machine name is 255 characters. The name can be re-used in different data centers in the environment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>VM ID</b></td>
   <td>The virtual machine ID. The virtual machine's creator can set a custom ID for that virtual machine. If no ID is specified during creation a UUID will be automatically assigned. For both custom and automatically-generated IDs, changes are not possible after virtual machine creation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Description</b></td>
   <td>A meaningful description of the new virtual machine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Comment</b></td>
   <td>A field for adding plain text human-readable comments regarding the virtual machine.</td>

   <td>Add or remove a selected **Affinity Label**.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Stateless</b></td>
   <td>Select this check box to run the virtual machine in stateless mode. This mode is used primarily for desktop virtual machines. Running a stateless desktop or server creates a new COW layer on the VM hard disk image where new and changed data is stored. Shutting down the stateless VM deletes the new COW layer, which returns the VM to its original state. Stateless virtual machines are useful when creating machines that need to be used for a short time, or by temporary staff.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Start in Pause Mode</b></td>
   <td>Select this check box to always start the virtual machine in pause mode. This option is suitable for virtual machines which require a long time to establish a SPICE connection; for example, virtual machines in remote locations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Delete Protection</b></td>
   <td>Select this check box to make it impossible to delete the virtual machine. It is only possible to delete the virtual machine if this check box is not selected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Instance Images</b></td>
   <td>
    <p>Click <b>Attach</b> to attach a floating disk to the virtual machine, or click <b>Create</b> to add a new virtual disk. Use the plus and minus buttons to add or remove additional virtual disks.</p>

The virtual size and the actual size of a preallocated disk are the same. Preallocated virtual disks take more time to create than thin provisioned virtual disks, but have better read and write performance. Preallocated virtual disks are recommended for servers and other I/O intensive virtual machines. If a virtual machine is able to write more than 1 GB every four seconds, use preallocated disks where possible.</li>
      <li><b>Thin Provision</b> allocates 1 GB at the time the virtual disk is created and sets a maximum limit on the size to which the disk can grow. The virtual size of the disk is the maximum limit; the actual size of the disk is the space that has been allocated so far. Thin provisioned disks are faster to create than preallocated disks and allow for storage over-commitment. Thin provisioned virtual disks are recommended for desktops.</li>

Fill in the fields in the **Discover Targets** section and click **Discover** to discover the target server. You can then click the **Login All** button to list the available LUNs on the target server and, using the radio buttons next to each LUN, select the LUN to add.

Using LUNs directly as virtual machine hard disk images removes a layer of abstraction between your virtual machines and their data.

The following considerations must be made when using a direct LUN as a virtual machine hard disk image:

* Live storage migration of direct LUN hard disk images is not supported.

* Direct LUN disks are not included in virtual machine exports.

* Direct LUN disks are not included in virtual machine snapshots.

The **Cinder** settings form will be disabled if there are no available OpenStack Volume storage domains on which you have permissions to create a disk in the relevant Data Center. **Cinder** disks require access to an instance of OpenStack Volume that has been added to the oVirt environment using the **External Providers** window.

**Important:** Mounting a journaled file system requires read-write access. Using the **Read Only** option is not appropriate for virtual disks that contain such file systems (e.g. **EXT3**, **EXT4**, or **XFS**).


## Explanation of Settings in the New Template Windows

The following table details the settings for the **New Template** window.
