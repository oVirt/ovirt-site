[[Guest_Agent_Hooks]]
==== Guest Agent Hooks

Hooks are scripts that trigger activity within a virtual machine when key events occur:

* Before migration

* After migration

* Before hibernation

* After hibernation



The hooks configuration base directory is `/etc/ovirt-guest-agent/hooks.d` on Linux systems and `C:\Program Files\Redhat\RHEV\Drivers\Agent` on Windows systems.

Each event has a corresponding subdirectory: `before_migration` and `after_migration`, `before_hibernation` and `after_hibernation`. All files or symbolic links in that directory will be executed.

The executing user on Linux systems is `ovirtagent`. If the script needs `root` permissions, the elevation must be executed by the creator of the hook script.

The executing user on Windows systems is the `System Service` user.
