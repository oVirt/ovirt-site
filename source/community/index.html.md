# Get Involved!

Everyone can contribute something back to the project — one doesn't have to be a programmer to make a difference!

When starting out, we suggest [signing up for the users@ovirt.org mailing list](Mailing_lists#Users) and sending an introductory email — just to introduce yourself and let people know what you're interested in related to oVirt. [Join us on IRC](Communication#IRC) and communicate with us too, if it's possible for you to do so.

We're looking forward to working with you!

## Find and File Bugs

As someone who uses the software, your help in finding and filing bugs is thoroughly appreciated.

[Report oVirt bugs on the Red Hat bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).
If you don't have a Bugzilla account yet, [find out how to get one](Reporting_a_bug).


## Translate, 翻译, ‫לתרגם‬

It's great to have the oVirt software itself in multiple languages, and even better to have its documentation available in everyone's native tongue too. Help improve oVirt by working on new translations and making each version the best it can be.

## Write Documentation

Have a knack for writing? [Request a wiki account](Special:RequestAccount), [log in](Special:UserLogin), and help out! oVirt needs excellent, easy-to-read documentation for installation and usage, and it needs to be kept up-to-date with every release of oVirt.

## Design

Whether you push pixels or strive to put users first — if you're a designer, you too have a place in the project. At every step of the way, from initial ideas to iterations through out the development process, design is valuable to the oVirt project.

## Develop the Code

Know how to program? Jump in and help us out. There's even a whole section of our website dedicated to you — start by reading the [develop section](Develop).

## Community Governance & Structure

oVirt is an [open source project](http://www.opensource.org) that is an [openly governed project](Governance). Learn more about [how the project is structured](Governance), [how projects can be added](Incubating_an_oVirt_Subproject), [who is on the board](OVirt_Board), and who are some of our [users and service providers](Users_and_Providers).
