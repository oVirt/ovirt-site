# oVirt 3.6.6 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.6.6 release as of May 23rd, 2016.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization. This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, CentOS Linux 6.7 (or similar) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2, CentOS Linux 7.2 (or similar).

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases,
check out the [previous versions release notes](/develop/release-management/releases/).

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm)

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release35 package already installed on your system. You can then install ovirt-release36.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

Once ovirt-release36 package is installed, you will have the ovirt-3.6-stable repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.

If you are upgrading from oVirt < 3.5.0, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.5.0 or later. Please see [oVirt 3.5.6 Release Notes](/develop/release-management/releases/3.5.6/) for upgrade instructions.

For upgrading now you just need to execute:

      # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
      # engine-setup

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install) guide.

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine) guide.

### oVirt Live

A new oVirt Live ISO is available at:

[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-live/`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-live/)

### oVirt Node

A new oVirt Node installation iso is available at: <http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-node-ng-installer/>

Download and install instructions are avaialble on the [Node Project](/develop/projects/node/node/) page.

### Enhancement

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1241149](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1241149) <b>[RFE] Provide way to preform in-cluster upgrade of hosts from el6->el7.</b><br>
 - [BZ 1332463](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1332463) <b>[RFE] restore: ensure that 3.6 on el6 backup can be restored on 3.6 on el7</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Allow engine-backup on el7 to restore backups taken on el6.<br><br>Reason: <br><br>engine 4.0 does not support el6. Users that want to upgrade from 3.6 on el6 to 4.0 on el7 have to do this by backing up the engine on 3.6/el6 and restore on 4.0/el7.<br><br>This feature, backported from 4.0, allows to do such a migration also in 3.6.<br><br>Result: <br><br>Using this flow, it's possible to migrate a el6 setup to el7:<br><br>On the existing engine machine run:<br>1. engine-backup \-\-mode=backup \-\-file=engine-3.6.bck \-\-log=backup.log<br><br>On a new el7 machine:<br>2. Install engine, including dwh if it was set up on el6.<br>3. Copy engine-3.6.bck to the el7 machine<br>4. engine-backup \-\-mode=restore \-\-file=engine-3.6.bck \-\-log=restore.log \-\-provision-db \-\-no-restore-permissions<br>5. engine-setup<br><br>Check engine-backup documentation for other options, including using remote databases, extra grants/permissions, etc.

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1324520](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1324520) <b>[RFE] Allow to skip tty check to allow for unattended install via Ansible</b><br>

### Release Note

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1323952](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1323952) <b>Change migration parameters</b><br>migration behavior changes - newly there will be only at most 2 migrations started(instead of 3) in parallel, at higher speed, to increase the chances that migrations converge instead of timing out. <br>Values can be changed back or to any other value in vdsm.conf
