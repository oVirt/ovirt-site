# Vds Client

**vdsClient is deprecated in 4.1 and above, please use [vdsm-client](./vdsm-client.html.md) instead.**

## About vdsClient

**vdsClient** is a console tool provided by VDSM. It can used to execute tests like: start virtual machines, manage storage, devices (CDROM, floppy), etc.

This document intend to be a quick reference for examples of how to use it, feel free to improve it. It's \*only\* recommended to use vdsClient for tests or development stage, **always \*use\* oVirt Engine to manage your stable environment**.

## Connecting to HOST

To connect to host, you can use **-s** as argument for secure connection (SSL) or can just pass as argument the name of host. Examples:

*   $ vdsClient -s HOST (vdsm daemon is listening with ssl enabled)
*   $ vdsClient HOST (no ssl enabled)

**tip**: If 0 is used as argument for HOST, means localhost

*   $ vdsClient -s HOST list
*   $ vdsClient -s HOST list table
