[[Reusing_LUNs]]
==== Reusing LUNs

LUNs cannot be reused, as is, to create a storage domain or virtual disk. If you try to reuse the LUNs, the Administration Portal displays the following error message:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Physical device initialization failed. Please check that the device is empty and accessible by the host.
----

A self-hosted engine shows the following error during installation:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
[ ERROR ] Error creating Volume Group: Failed to initialize physical device: ("[u'/dev/mapper/000000000000000000000000000000000']",)
[ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Misc configuration': Failed to initialize physical device: ("[u'/dev/mapper/000000000000000000000000000000000']",)

Before the LUN can be reused, the old partitioning table must be cleared.

*Clearing the Partition Table from a LUN*

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must run this procedure on the correct LUN so that you do not inadvertently destroy data.
====

Run the `dd` command with the ID of the LUN that you want to reuse, the maximum number of bytes to read and write at a time, and the number of input blocks to copy:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/LUN_ID bs=1M count=200 oflag=direct
