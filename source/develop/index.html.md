## Projects

oVirt is a [collection of projects](/documentation/architecture/architecture/) which work together to provide a complete data center virtualization solution.

ovirt-engine
: oVirt Engine allows you to configure your network, storage, nodes and images. oVirt Engine also provides a command line interface tool (ovirt-engine-cli) and a RESTful API (ovirt-engine-api), including a Python wrapper (ovirt-engine-python-sdk) which allow developers to integrate management functionality into shell scripts of third party applications.

VDSM
: The Virtual Desktop and Server Management daemon runs on oVirt managed nodes, and allows oVirt to remotely deploy, start, stop and monitor virtual machines running on the node.

ovirt-node
: oVirt Node is just enough operating system to run virtual machines. It is also possible to convert a standard Linux distribution into a node which can be managed by ovirt-engine by installing VDSM and other dependencies.

dwh and reports
: The reports and data warehouse components for ovirt-engine are optional, and are packaged and developed separately.
