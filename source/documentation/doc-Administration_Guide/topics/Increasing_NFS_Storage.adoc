==== Increasing NFS Storage

To increase the amount of NFS storage, you can either create a new storage domain and add it to an existing data center, or increase the available free space on the NFS server. For the former option, see xref:Adding_NFS_Storage_storage_admin[]. The following procedure explains how to increase the available free space on the existing NFS server.


*Increasing an Existing NFS Storage Domain*

. Click menu:Storage[Domains].
. Click the NFS storage domain's name. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Data Center* tab and click *Maintenance* to place the storage domain into maintenance mode. This unmounts the existing share and makes it possible to resize the storage domain.
. On the NFS server, resize the storage.
