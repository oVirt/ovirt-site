= Manually Fencing or Isolating a Non-Responsive Host

If a host unpredictably goes into a non-responsive state, for example, due to a hardware failure, it can significantly affect the performance of the environment. If you do not have a power management device, or if it is incorrectly configured, you can reboot the host manually.

[WARNING]
====
Do not select *Confirm 'Host has been Rebooted'* unless you have manually rebooted the host. Using this option while the host is still running can lead to a virtual machine image corruption.

.Procedure

. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts] and confirm the host's status is `Non Responsive`.
. Manually reboot the host. This could mean physically entering the lab and rebooting the host.
. In the Administration Portal, select the host and click *More Actions* (image:common/images/moreactions.png[title="More Actions menu"]), then click *Confirm 'Host has been Rebooted'*.
. Select the *Approve Operation* check box and click btn:[OK].
. If your hosts take an unusually long time to boot, you can set `ServerRebootTimeout` to specify how many seconds to wait before determining that the host is `Non Responsive`:
