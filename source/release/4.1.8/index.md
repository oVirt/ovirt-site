# oVirt 4.1.8 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.1.8
release as of December 11, 2017.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4,
CentOS Linux 7.4 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.1.8, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1501793](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1501793) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.8] [RFE] Indicate host needs to be reinstalled to push new configurations.</b><br>There are several cluster and host settings which require reinstallation of the host if changed. The requirement to reinstall was always mentioned in documentation and a WARNING event was raised. With this release, the Administration Portal now also shows an exclamation mark icon for each host that needs to be reinstalled. When an exclamation mark icon is shown, you can find the details about it in the Action Items section of the host's details view.
