# Testing Framework

## Summary

We aim to build upstream system testing framework for oVirt and its related components (VDSM, vdsm-tool, Host-Deploy, Hosted-Engine, Registration tool and so on).

When integrating oVirt components for new build we need to run full set of system flows which can assure us that all related logical flows won't get effected or changed due to regression or new behavior. This related to storage, network and virt flows all over the project.
