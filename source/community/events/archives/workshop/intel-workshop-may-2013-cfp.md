# Intel Workshop May 2013 CFP

Intel oVirt Workshop May 2013 | Call For Participation

<b>All submissions must be received by March 29th, 2013 at 11:55pm (PST).</b>

Ovirt strives to become the first and best truly open and comprehensive data center virtualization management suite. As the oVirt community is rapidly evolving and growing one of the ways we look to connect is through oVirt Workshops around the globe. The May 2013 oVirt workshop will be held at [Intel's Shanghai Campus](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=No.+880+Zi+Xing+Road+Zizhu+Science+Park+Minhang,+Shanghai+200241+China&hl=en&sll=23.141807,113.324834&sspn=0.077662,0.153122&t=h&hq=No.+880+Zi+Xing+Road+Zizhu+Science+Park+Minhang,+Shanghai+200241+China&radius=15000&z=13).

## Proposal Guidelines

### Tips For Preparing a Successful Proposal

*   Identify your target audience: There are going to be a diverse group in attendance, don't be afraid to go deep in content.
*   What is the level of expertise required: Is your presentation configured for for beginners, advanced users, core developers, IT professionals, CTOs?
*   Keep it relevant: why would someone want to attend your presentation? Is this a critical project or are you providing insight into an existing problem and require community input?
*   Watch the clock: your presentation should stick around only have 50 minutes, so make sure your proposal has a very specific scope
*   Not just technical knowledge: Don't limit your presentation to oVirt only topics. Integration is key, so feel free to submit proposals in regards to hardware or configuration options that help strengthen either the oVirt project or oVirt deployments.
*   Engage! We are looking for the type of presenters who will engage people so that they close their laptops (or at least look up every once in a while) and listen.
*   If you are proposing a panel discussion, please ensure that you mention all of the participants (please include company name and job title).
*   For technical tutorials, please keep in mind that your material should be focused on giving attendees the ability to walk away with skills and/or knowledge that they can use immediately.
