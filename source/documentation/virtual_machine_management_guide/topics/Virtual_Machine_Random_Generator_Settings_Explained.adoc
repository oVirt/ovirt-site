|Field Name
|Description
|Power cycle required?


|*Random Generator enabled*
|Selecting this check box enables a paravirtualized Random Number Generator PCI device (virtio-rng). This device allows entropy to be passed from the host to the virtual machine in order to generate a more sophisticated random number. Note that this check box can only be selected if the RNG device exists on the host and is enabled in the host's cluster.
|Yes.


|*Period duration (ms)*
|Specifies the duration of the RNG's "full cycle" or "full period" in milliseconds. If omitted, the libvirt default of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) is used. If this field is filled,
*Bytes per period* must be filled also.
|Yes.


|*Bytes per period*
|Specifies how many bytes are permitted to be consumed per period.
|Yes.


|*Device source:*
a|The source of the random number generator. This is automatically selected depending on the source supported by the host's cluster.

* */dev/urandom source* - The Linux-provided random number generator.

* */dev/hwrng source* - An external hardware generator.
|Yes.
