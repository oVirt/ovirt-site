[id='Preparing_Storage_for_RHV_{context}']
= Preparing Storage for {virt-product-fullname}

Prepare storage to be used for storage domains in the new environment. A {virt-product-fullname} environment must have at least one data storage domain, but adding more is recommended.

A data domain holds the virtual hard disks and OVF files of all the virtual machines and templates in a data center, and cannot be shared across data centers while active (but can be migrated between data centers). Data domains of multiple storage types can be added to the same data center, provided they are all shared, rather than local, domains.

You can use one of the following storage types:

* xref:Preparing_NFS_Storage_{context}[NFS]

* xref:Preparing_iSCSI_Storage_{context}[iSCSI]

* xref:Preparing_FCP_Storage_{context}[Fibre Channel (FCP)]

ifdef::SM_localDB_deploy,SM_remoteDB_deploy[]
//Not supported for SHE (doesn't appear as an option in the deployment)
* xref:Preparing_POSIX_Storage_{context}[POSIX-compliant file system]

* xref:Preparing_Local_Storage_{context}[Local storage]
endif::SM_localDB_deploy,SM_remoteDB_deploy[]

* xref:Preparing_Red_Hat_Gluster_Storage_{context}[{gluster-storage-fullname}]

.Prerequisites

* Self-hosted engines must have an additional data domain with at least 74&nbsp;GiB dedicated to the {engine-name} virtual machine. The self-hosted engine installer creates this domain. Prepare the storage for this domain before installation.

* When using a block storage domain, either FCP or iSCSI, a single target LUN is the only supported setup for a self-hosted engine.

* If you use iSCSI storage, the self-hosted engine storage domain must use a dedicated iSCSI target. Any additional storage domains must use a different iSCSI target.

endif::SHE_cockpit_deploy,SHE_cli_deploy,migrating_to_SHE,SHE_backup_restore,SHE_restore_only[]

ifdef::SHE_cockpit_deploy,SHE_cli_deploy,migrating_to_SHE[]
// Not needed for standalone {engine-name} (irrelevant) or SHE backup/restore (SHE storage is already set up)

* It is strongly recommended to create additional data storage domains in the same data center as the self-hosted engine storage domain. If you deploy the self-hosted engine in a data center with only one active data storage domain, and that storage domain is corrupted, you cannot add new storage domains or remove the corrupted storage domain. You must redeploy the self-hosted engine.

[WARNING]
====
If you are using NFS or Gluster storage, do not use the old self-hosted engine storage domain's mount point to deploy the new storage domain, as you risk losing virtual machine data.
