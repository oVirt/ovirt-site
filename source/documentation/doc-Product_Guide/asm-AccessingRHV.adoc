= Accessing {virt-product-fullname}

{virt-product-fullname} exposes a number of interfaces for interacting with the components of the virtualization environment. Many of these interfaces are fully supported.
ifdef::rhv-doc[]
Some, however, are supported only for read access or only when your use of them has been explicitly requested by Red Hat Support.

[id="supported-interfaces-for-read-and-write-access"]
== Supported Interfaces for Read and Write Access

Direct interaction with these interfaces is supported and encouraged for both read and write access:

*Administration Portal*:: The Administration Portal is a graphical user interface provided by the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. It can be used to manage all the administrative resources in the environment and can be accessed by any supported web browsers.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#[_Administration Guide_]

*VM Portal*:: The VM Portal is a graphical user interface provided by the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. It has limited permissions for managing virtual machine resources and is targeted at end users.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}introduction_to_the_vm_portal/index#[_Introduction to the VM Portal_]

*Cockpit*:: In {virt-product-fullname}, the Cockpit web interface can be used to perform administrative tasks on a host. It is available by default on {hypervisor-fullname}s, and can be installed on {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s.

*REST API*:: The {virt-product-fullname} REST API provides a software interface for querying and modifying the {virt-product-fullname} environment. The REST API can be used by any programming language that supports HTTP actions.
+
See: link:{URL_downstream_virt_product_docs}rest_api_guide/index[_REST API Guide_]

*Software Development Kit (SDK)*:: The Python and Java are fully supported interfaces for interacting with the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}.
+

See:

* link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}python_sdk_guide/index#[_Python SDK Guide_]

* link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}java_sdk_guide/index#[_Java SDK Guide_]

*Ansible*:: Ansible provides modules to automate post-installation tasks on {virt-product-fullname}.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#chap-Automating_RHV_Configuration_using_Ansible[Automating Configuration Tasks using Ansible] in the _Administration Guide_.

*Self-Hosted Engine Command Line Utility*:: The `hosted-engine` command is used to perform administrative tasks on the {engine-name} virtual machine in self-hosted engine environments.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#administering_the_manager_virtual_machine[Administering the {engine-name} Virtual Machine] in the _Administration Guide_.

*VDSM Hooks*:: VDSM hooks trigger modifications to virtual machines, based on custom properties specified in the Administration Portal.
+
See: link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#appe-VDSM_and_Hooks[VDSM and Hooks] in the _Administration Guide_.

Red Hat Support will not debug user-created scripts or hooks except where it can be demonstrated that there is an issue with the interface being used rather than the user-created script itself.
