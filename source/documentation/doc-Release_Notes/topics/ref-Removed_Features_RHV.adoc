|OpenStack Neutron deployment |The {virt-product-fullname} 4.4.0 release removes OpenStack Neutron deployment,
including the automatic deployment of the Neutron agents through the `Network Provider` tab in the `New Host` window and the `AgentConfiguration` in the REST-API. Use the following components instead:

-  To deploy `OpenStack` hosts, use the `OpenStack Platform Director/TripleO`.

- The `Open vSwitch` interface mappings are already managed automatically by `VDSM` in clusters with switch type `OVS`.

- To manage the deployment of `ovirt-provider-ovn-driver` on a cluster, update the cluster's "Default Network Provider" attribute.
