Upgrading a self-hosted engine environment from version 4.2 to 4.3 involves the following steps:

. xref:Upgrade_Prerequisites_4-2_SHE[Make sure you meet the prerequisites, including enabling the correct repositories]

ifdef::rhv-doc[]
. xref:Analyzing_the_Environment_4-2_SHE[Use the Log Collection Analysis tool to check for issues that might prevent a successful upgrade]
endif::[]

. xref:Enabling_Global_Maintenance_Mode_4-2_SHE[Place the environment in global maintenance mode]

. xref:Updating_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_4-2_SHE[Update the 4.2 {engine-name} to the latest version of 4.2]

. xref:Upgrading_the_Manager_to_4-3_4-2_SHE[Upgrade the {engine-name} from 4.2 to 4.3]

. xref:Disabling_Global_Maintenance_Mode_4-2_SHE[Disable global maintenance mode]

. xref:Updating_all_hosts_in_a_cluster_4-2_SHE[Upgrade the self-hosted engine nodes, and any standard hosts]

. xref:Changing_the_Cluster_Compatibility_Version_4-2_SHE[Update the compatibility version of the clusters]

. xref:Changing_Virtual_Machine_Cluster_Compatibility_4-2_SHE[Reboot any running or suspended virtual machines to update their configuration]

. xref:Changing_the_Data_Center_Compatibility_Version_4-2_SHE[Update the compatibility version of the data centers]

. If you previously upgraded to 4.2 without replacing SHA-1 certificates with SHA-256 certificates, xref:Replacing_SHA-1_Certificates_with_SHA-256_Certificates_4-2_SHE[you must replace the certificates now].

* Ensure the {engine-name} has the correct repositories enabled.

// Add new {engine-name} upgrade versions here

You can now update the self-hosted engine nodes, and then any standard hosts. The procedure is the same for both host types.

include::common/upgrade/proc-Changing_the_Data_Center_Compatibility_Version.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// Can be removed in 4.4
If you previously upgraded to 4.2 without replacing SHA-1 certificates with SHA-256 certificates, you must do so now.
