==== Creating a New Data Center

This procedure creates a data center in your virtualization environment. The data center requires a functioning cluster, host, and storage domain to operate.

[NOTE]
====
After you set the *Compatibility Version*, you cannot lower the version number. Version regression is not supported.

You can specify a MAC pool range for a cluster. Setting a MAC pool range is no longer supported.

*Creating a New Data Center*

. Click menu:Compute[Data Centers].
. Click *New*.
. Enter the *Name* and *Description* of the data center.
. Select the *Storage Type*, *Compatibility Version*, and *Quota Mode* of the data center from the drop-down menus.
. Click btn:[OK] to create the data center and open the *Data Center - Guide Me* window.
. The *Guide Me* window lists the entities that need to be configured for the data center. Configure these entities or postpone configuration by clicking the *Configure Later* button. Configuration can be resumed by selecting the data center and clicking *More Actions* (image:../common/images/moreactions.png[]), then clicking *Guide Me*.


The new data center will remain *Uninitialized* until a cluster, host, and storage domain are configured for it; use *Guide Me* to configure these entities.
