# Creating a Trusted Cluster

Trusted clusters communicate with an OpenAttestation server to assess the security of hosts. When a host is added to a trusted cluster, the OpenAttestation server measures the host's hardware and software against a White List database. Virtual machines can be migrated between trusted hosts in the trusted cluster, allowing for high availability in a secure environment.
