# Destroying a Storage Domain

A storage domain encountering errors may not be able to be removed through the normal procedure. Destroying a storage domain will forcibly remove the storage domain from the virtualized environment without reference to the export directory.

When the storage domain is destroyed, you are required to manually fix the export directory of the storage domain before it can be used again.

**Destroying a Storage Domain**

1. Use the **Storage** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the appropriate storage domain in the results list.

2. Right-click the storage domain and select **Destroy** to open the **Destroy Storage Domain** confirmation window.

3. Select the **Approve operation** check box and click **OK** to destroy the storage domain and close the window.

The storage domain has been destroyed. Manually clean the export directory for the storage domain to recycle it.
