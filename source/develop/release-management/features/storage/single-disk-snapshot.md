# Single Disk Snapshot

## Summary

Customization of snapshots with regards to VM configuration and disks.

## Owner

*   Name: Daniel Erez (Derez)
*   Email: <derez@redhat.com>

## Current status

*   Target Release: 3.4
*   Status: released

## Benefit to oVirt

*   Allow creation of a customized snapshot. I.e. selecting which disks to take snapshot on.
*   Custom snapshot preview:
    -   Previewing a new state by selecting VM configuration and disks from various snapshots.
    -   Support commit to the new state and undo to the previous one.
*   Features based on specific disks snapshots, such as [Storage Live Migration](/develop/release-management/features/storage/storagelivemigration), will benefit from the new support
    -   E.g. LSM will take a snapshot only on the migrated disks - as opposed to the current situation in which a snapshot is taken on all disks.

## Detailed Description

Currently, a Snapshot represents a single point in time that contains the configuration of the VM and all attached disks.

I.e. creating/previewing/committing a snapshot must be done on the entire VM - including all the disks.

This feature introduces the ability to remove the constraint by allowing to exclude disks from a snapshot.

In addition, adds a new functionality of creating a customized snapshot composed of configuration and disk from multiple snapshots.

### REST-API

Add <disks> tag to create/restore snapshot.

Note: preview only is not available from rest (restore = preview + commit).

#### Create Snapshot:

```xml
POST /api/vms/{vm_id}/snapshots

<snapshot>
 <vm id="{vm_id}"/>
 <disks>
  <disk id="{disk_id}"/>
 </disks>
</snapshot>
```

#### Restore Snapshot:

```xml
POST /api/vms/{vm_id}/snapshots/{snapshot_id}/restore

<action>
 <restore_memory>"true|false"</restore_memory>
 <disks>
  <disk id="{disk_id}">
   <image_id>"{image_id}"</image_id>
   <snapshot id="{snapshot_id}"/>
  </disk>
 </disks>
</action>
```

#### oVirt 3.5

#### Preview Snapshot:

```xml
POST /api/vms/{vm_id}/preview_snapshot

<action>
 <snapshot id="{snapshot_id}"/>
 <restore_memory>`true|false`</restore_memory>
 <disks>
  <disk id="{disk_id}">
   <image_id>`{image_id}`</image_id>
   <snapshot id="{snapshot_id}"/>
  </disk>
 </disks>
</action>
```

### Backend

*   CreateAllSnapshotsFromVmCommand
    -   The command should support handling a specified disks list.
    -   Disks not included in specified list should be 'fast-forwarded' to active snapshot (i.e. update snapshot id without creating a new snapshot).
*   TryBackToAllSnapshotsOfVmCommand
    -   The command should support handling a specified disks list.
    -   Ability to preview a subset of VM disks.
    -   Allow previewing to various points of time (each specified image can define a different snapshot).
    -   Support previewing only disks while keeping the current VM configuration.
    -   Keeping old API from 'regular' preview.
*   RestoreAllSnapshotsCommand
    -   Identify on which disks to perform snapshot undo/commit.
    -   Skip restore for excluded disks (but keep updating snapshot id accordingly).
*   GetAllVmSnapshotsByVmIdQuery
    -   Configurable support to return the snapshots with appropriate images list.
    -   Fetch disks data from VM configuration which resides in the OVF (depending on UI design).
*   Snapshot
    -   Add a list of disk images.

### VDSM

Already supported.

## Open Issues

*   Custom Preview Dialog
    -   What to display at the bottom section?
        -   "Result" - i.e. the state to preview.
        -   VM configuration - i.e. the bottom section updates on configuration selection.
        -   Decision: the bottom section displays the 'result' snapshot.
    -   Memory (applicable only for live snapshot)
        -   Should we allow configuration/memory decoupling?
        -   Or, configuration selection enforces the selection of memory from same snapshot (and vice versa)?
        -   Decision: VM configuration and memory are coupled. I.e. one cannot preview memory of a snapshot without selecting the same snapshot's configuration.
    -   Allow excluding a disk from preview (deselecting entire column)?
        -   Excluding a disk implications are similar to deleting a disk (will result with an illegal disk on previous snapshots).
        -   Decision: allow disk exclude for now.

## Testing

*   Verify that create snapshot flow has no regressions.
*   Verify that the 'regular' preview/undo/commit flow has no regressions.
*   Create a snapshot with a subset of disks.
*   Custom preview a snapshot from various point of times.
*   Undo/commit a custom previewed snapshot.

## Future Work

*   Revise error flows
    -   E.g. failing to take a snapshot on one disk shouldn't rollback the entire snapshot, instead, just exclude the disk from the snapshot.
*   Continue the decoupling of snapshot components and use single disks snapshots when needed, as in LSM flow.
*   Create a snapshot form disk context
    -   Select a disk -> create snapshot (still requires including the VM configuration).
*   Preview/commit/undo a snapshot from disk context
    -   Only a subset of the disks at a time, since creating a preview snapshot locks most VM operations (adding/removing disks, etc).
*   Exclude VM configuration
    -   Do we want to allow creating a snapshot without VM configuration?
*   Detach/Attach of disks with snapshots
    -   How to represent/display snapshots of a floating disk?
    -   How to handle attach of a disk with snapshots to a different VM?
*   Profiles
    -   Creating a snapshot profiles (which allows single click snapshot). E.g. 'VM configuration + OS disk profile' / etc.
