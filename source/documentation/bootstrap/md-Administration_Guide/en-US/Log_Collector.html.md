# Log Collector

A log collection tool is included in the Red Hat Virtualization Manager. This allows you to easily collect relevant logs from across the Red Hat Virtualization environment when requesting support.

The log collection command is `ovirt-log-collector`. You are required to log in as the `root` user and provide the administration credentials for the Red Hat Virtualization environment. The `ovirt-log-collector `-h`` command displays usage information, including a list of all valid options for the `ovirt-log-collector` command.
