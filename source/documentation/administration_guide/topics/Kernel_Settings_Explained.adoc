= Kernel Settings Explained

The *Kernel* settings table details the information required on the *Kernel* tab of the *New Host* or *Edit Host* window. Common kernel boot parameter options are listed as check boxes so you can easily select them.

For more complex changes, use the free text entry field next to *Kernel command line* to add in any additional parameters required. If you change any kernel command line parameters, you must  xref:Reinstalling_Hosts_admin[reinstall the host].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the host is attached to the {engine-name}, you must place the host into maintenance mode before making changes. After making the changes, xref:Reinstalling_Hosts_admin[reinstall the host] to apply the changes.

.*Kernel* Settings
[options="header"]
|===
|Field Name |Description
|*Hostdev Passthrough &amp; SR-IOV* |Enables the IOMMU flag in the kernel so a virtual machine can use a host device as if it is attached directly to the virtual machine. The host hardware and firmware must also support IOMMU. The virtualization extension and IOMMU extension must be enabled on the hardware. See xref:Configuring_a_Host_for_PCI_Passthrough_host_tasks[Configuring a Host for PCI Passthrough]. IBM POWER8 has IOMMU enabled by default.
|*Nested Virtualization* |Enables the `vmx` or `svm` flag so virtual machines can run within virtual machines. This option is a Technology Preview feature: It is intended only for evaluation purposes. It is not supported for production purposes. To use this setting, you must install the `vdsm-hook-nestedvt` hook on the host. For details, see xref:proc-enabling-nested-virtualization-for-all-virtual-machines[Enabling nested virtualization for all virtual machines] and xref:proc-enabling-nested-virtualization-for-individual-virtual-machines[Enabling nested virtualization for individual virtual machines]
|*Unsafe Interrupts* |If IOMMU is enabled but the passthrough fails because the hardware does not support interrupt remapping, you can consider enabling this option. Note that you should only enable this option if the virtual machines on the host are trusted; having the option enabled potentially exposes the host to MSI attacks from the virtual machines. This option is only intended to be used as a workaround when using uncertified hardware for evaluation purposes.
|*PCI Reallocation* |If your SR-IOV NIC is unable to allocate virtual functions because of memory issues, consider enabling this option. The host hardware and firmware must also support PCI reallocation. This option is only intended to be used as a workaround when using uncertified hardware for evaluation purposes.
|*Blacklist Nouveau* | Blocks the nouveau driver. Nouveau is a community driver for NVIDIA GPUs that conflicts with vendor-supplied drivers. The nouveau driver should be blocked when vendor drivers take precedence.
|*SMT Disabled* | Disables Simultaneous Multi Threading (SMT). Disabling SMT can mitigate security vulnerabilities, such as L1TF or MDS.
ifdef::rhv-doc[]
|*FIPS mode* |Enables FIPS mode. For details, see xref:enabling-fips_in_rhv[Enabling FIPS using the {engine-name}].
endif::rhv-doc[]

|*Kernel command line* |This field allows you to append more kernel parameters to the default parameters.
