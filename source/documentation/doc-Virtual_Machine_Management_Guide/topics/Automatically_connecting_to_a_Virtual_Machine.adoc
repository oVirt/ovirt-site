==== Automatically Connecting to a Virtual Machine

Once you have logged in, you can automatically connect to a single running virtual machine. This can be configured in the VM Portal.


*Automatically Connecting to a Virtual Machine*

. In the Virtual Machines page, click the name of the virtual machine to go to the details view.
. Click the pencil icon beside *Console* and set *Connect automatically* to *ON*.

The next time you log into the VM Portal, if you have only one running virtual machine, you will automatically connect to that machine.
