=== Editing a Virtual Machine Pool

After a virtual machine pool has been created, its properties can be edited. The properties available when editing a virtual machine pool are identical to those available when creating a new virtual machine pool except that the *Number of VMs* property is replaced by *Increase number of VMs in pool by*.

[NOTE]
====
When editing a virtual machine pool, the changes introduced affect only new virtual machines. Virtual machines that existed already at the time of the introduced changes remain unaffected.
