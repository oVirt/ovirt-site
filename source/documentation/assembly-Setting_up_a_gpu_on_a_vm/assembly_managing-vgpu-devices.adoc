= Setting up a GPU and using it on a virtual machine

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID
// includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if
// it is reused multiple times in a guide.

You can use a host with a compatible graphics processing unit (GPU) to run virtual machines that are suited for graphics-intensive tasks and for running software that cannot run without a GPU, such as CAD.

You can assign a GPU to a virtual machine in one of the following ways:

* *GPU passthrough*. In this usage model, you assign a host GPU to a single virtual machine, so the virtual machine, instead of the host, uses the GPU.

* You can divide a physical GPU device into one or more virtual devices, referred to as _mediated devices_. You can then assign these mediated devices to one or more virtual machines as virtual GPUs. These virtual machines share the performance of a single physical GPU. For some GPUs, only one mediated device can be assigned to a single guest. vGPU support is only available on selected NVIDIA GPUs.
