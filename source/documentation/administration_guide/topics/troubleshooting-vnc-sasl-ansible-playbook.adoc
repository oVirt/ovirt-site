= VNC SASL Ansible playbook error message

When running the VNC SASL Ansible playbook, the task might fail with the following error message:

[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
Using a SSH password instead of a key is not possible because Host Key checking is enabled and sshpass does not support this.  Please add this host's fingerprint to your known_hosts file to manage this host.
----

To solve this problem, disable host key checking by doing one of the following:

* Disable host key checking permanently by uncommenting the following line in [filename]`/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
#host_key_checking = False
----

* Disable host key checking temporarily by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
----
