# Importing Xen on EL 5.x VMs to oVirt
-----------------------------------------------------------
## Summary
oVirt has the ability to import VMs from other hypervisor including **Xen** on EL 5.x (not yet for Citrix Xen)
The Import process uses [virt-v2v][1] (under the "INPUT FROM EL 5 XEN" section) which explain the prerequisites that are needed in order to import Xen VMs.

This feature is available from version 4.0

## Importing VM
In order to import VMs password-less SSH access has to be enabled between VDSM host and the Xen host.
The following steps needed to be done at the VDSM host:
- Generate ssh kes for vdsm user ```sudo -u vdsm ssh-keygen```
- Copy vdsms public key to the Xen host```sudo -u vdsm ssh-copy-id user@xenhost```
- Login to the remote host (in order to test the connection and add the Xen host to the known_hosts file ```sudo -u vdsm ssh user@xenhost```
- Exit the remote Xen host ```logout```

We are logging to the xenhost after we copy the ssh key in order to check that the ssh-copy-id succeeded and in order to set the host public key in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts.

## Import VMs from Xen
- Login to oVirt admin portal
- In VM tab click the 'Import' button in the toolbar
- Select **'XEN (via EL)'** in the source select box
- Select VDSM host from the 'Proxy Host' select box
- Enter valid URI such as: ```xen+ssh://user@xenhost```
