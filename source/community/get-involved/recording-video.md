This page will contain instructions on recording a screencast on Linux and Windows for oVirt demo screencasts.

## GNOME 3

# Adding a soundtrack

## GNOME

*   Start GNOME Sound Recorder
*   Start playing the video recorded previously
*   Record your voice-over (use a microphone to get better sound quality)
*   Use Pitivi to synchronise sound and image, and to cut beginning and end bits out.
*   Save in a YouTube compatible format which is not patent encumbered such as .ogv or .webm
