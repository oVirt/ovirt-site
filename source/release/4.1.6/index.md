# oVirt 4.1.6 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.1.6
release as of September 18, 2017.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4,
CentOS Linux 7.4 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.1.6, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL


In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-releaserelease41.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the epel repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

This LLDP frames<br>    are ignored, if the NIC of the oVirt host is not attached to the<br>    corresponding oVirt logical network.

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1479677](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1479677) <b>[RFE] - LLDP protocol REST API support</b><br>Feature<br>    Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) Support<br><br>Reason<br>    To support the integration of oVirt with other software, the information<br>    gathered by LLDP on each host will be provided by oVirt Engine's REST-API.<br>    Some of the information, like the number of the switch port a network<br>    interface of the host is connected to, might be helpful for the user and<br>    will be shown in the graphical user interface.<br><br>Result<br>    oVirt Engine provides access via REST-API to values gathered on the hosts by LLDP.<br><br>Known Issue BZ#1487930<br>    Cisco switches might send LLDP frames 802.1Q VLAN tagged. This LLDP frames<br>    are ignored, if the NIC of the oVirt host is not attached to the<br>    corresponding oVirt logical network.

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1481095](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1481095) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.6] [bug] hosted-engine yum repo required, but rpm-based install optional</b><br>The user now has the option of specifying a path to the appliance OVF, as an alternative to installing the appliance RPM.

#### oVirt Ansible Roles

 - [BZ 1482104](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1482104) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.6] [RFE] Introduce ovirt-ansible-roles package</b><br>The ovirt-ansible-roles package contains Ansible roles, which can help administrators with common Red Hat Virtualization administration tasks. All roles can be executed from the command line using Ansible, but some of those roles can also be executed directly from the Red Hat Virtualization Manager. More details about the roles can be found in README.md included in the package (/usr/share/doc/ovirt-ansible-roles/README.md), or directly in the source code repository (https://github.com/ovirt/ovirt-ansible).<br><br>Please note that currently Ansible has the following bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1487113<br>Because of this bug you should avoid calling multiple oVirt Ansible roles in a single playbook, or calling oVirt Ansible modules prior to calling oVirt Ansible roles in a single playbook (the working solution is to call the modules from the pre_tasks).

#### ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap

 - [BZ 1472254](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1472254) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.6] [RFE] - AD domain configuration is not supported in ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap-setup, provide examples how to configure AD domain</b><br>When configuring Active Directory (AD) with the ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap-setup tool, regardless of whether you are defining a multiple or single domain forest, you can only configure the name of the forest - you cannot define the name of a specific domain or a specific server.<br><br>This release provides examples for common advanced AD configuration which users can copy to their local environment and adapt as required. These examples are bundled within the ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap package and after installing the package, a description of these examples can be found in /usr/share/ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap/examples/README.md<br><br>In addition, the following improvements have been made to the ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap-setup tool:<br><br>1. A more detailed error reporting for various AD forest configuration steps.<br>2. A mandatory login test that checks the configuration (previously this test was optional).
