# Enabling and Changing a Quota Mode in a Data Center

This procedure enables or changes the quota mode in a data center. You must select a quota mode before you can define quotas. You must be logged in to the Administration Portal to follow the steps of this procedure.

Use **Audit** mode to test your quota to make sure it works as you expect it to. You do not need to have your quota in **Audit** mode to create or change a quota.

**Enabling and Changing Quota in a Data Center**

1. Click the **Data Centers** tab in the Navigation Pane.

2. From the list of data centers displayed in the Navigation Pane, choose the data center whose quota policy you plan to edit.

3. Click **Edit** in the top left of the Navigation Pane.

    An **Edit Data Center** window opens.

4. In the **Quota Mode** drop-down, change the quota mode to **Enforced**.

5. Click **OK**.

You have now enabled a quota mode at the Data Center level. If you set the quota mode to **Audit** during testing, then you must change it to **Enforced** in order for the quota settings to take effect.
