# oVirt 4.2.0 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.0
First Alpha release
 as of September 28, 2017.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4,
CentOS Linux 7.4 (or similar).


To find out how to interact with oVirt developers and users and ask questions,
visit our [community page]"(/community/).
All issues or bugs should be reported via 
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).

** This pre-release version should not be used in production, and is not feature
complete.**


For a general overview of oVirt, read the [Quick Start Guide](/documentation/quickstart/quickstart-guide/)
and visit the [About oVirt](/documentation/introduction/about-ovirt/) page.

For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

## What's New in 4.2.0?

- The **Administration Portal** has been redesigned from scratch using [Patternfly](http://www.patternfly.org), a widely adopted standard in web application design that promotes consistency and usability across IT applications, through UX patterns and widgets. The result is a cleaner, more intuitive and user-friendly user interface. The old horizontal menu has been replaced by a two-level vertical menu. The system tree is gone, and its functionality has been integrated into the vertical menus.

- An all new **VM Portal** for non-admin users - designed with React-based UI and Patternfly principles - replaces the existing User Portal. Built with performance and ease of use in mind, the VM Portal keeps the Extended view of the User Portal, plus streamlined functionality. 

- A new **High Performance** virtual machine (VM) type has been added to the New VM dialog box in the Administration Portal. By selecting the ‘High Performance’ option in the ‘Optimized for’ field, administrators can effortlessly optimize a VM for high performance workloads.

- **Open Virtual Network (OVN)** adds support for Open vSwitch virtual networking. oVirt VMs can now use logical overlay networks defined by OVN, allowing the user to manage and define multiple logical networks via one physical network. OVN is managed either via the oVirt Administration Portal, or REST.  For more information, see the OVN feature page. 

- oVirt now supports **Nvidia vGPU**, a technology that enables users to shard a GRID capable physical GPU - such as Nvidia Tesla M60 - into a number of smaller instances. Each instance can be assigned to a VM, for GPU-accelerated workloads.
 
- The **ovirt-ansible-roles** package helps users with common administration tasks. All roles can be executed from the command line using Ansible, and some are executed directly from oVirt engine. You can learn [how to use oVirt Ansible roles](https://ovirt.org/blog/2017/08/ovirt-ansible-roles-how-to-use/) on the oVirt blog.

- **Virt-v2v** - the tool that converts VMs from a foreign hypervisor to run on KVM - now supports **Debian/Ubuntu** based VMs, in addition to the supported RPM and Windows-based VMs. It is available for VDSM hosts running on RHEL 7.4, and from oVirt hosts versions 4.0 and above.

- oVirt 4.2.0 uses **PostgresSQL 9.5** as its database, for improved performance.

- Support is now restored for **Gluster ISO domains**, without the need for NFS which was previously disabled by Gluster. 

- **Affinity labels** create a positive affinity between the hosts and VMs to which they are applied. The new Affinity Labels sub tab for clusters, hosts, and VMs in the Administration Portal provides a table view of labels associated with the currently selected entity, as well as the option to add, edit, and delete them. Additionally, existing labels can be added and/or removed from VMs and hosts in their respective new/edit popup dialogs.

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.0, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL


## ALPHA RELEASE

In order to install this Alplha Release you will need to enable pre-release repository.


In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42-pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42-pre.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).



### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade-guide/upgrade-guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.


### Release Note

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1438822](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1438822) <b>The discard_enable flag should not be used anymore in oVirt 4.2</b><br>Since "Discard After Delete" can and should be configured per block storage domain, we now drop the support for configuring it per host (thus dropping the value discard_enable from vdsm configuration file).<br><br>For more information please visit the feature page - http://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/storage/discard-after-delete/ .

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1425935](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1425935) <b>[RFE] Add SSO client command line registration tool</b><br>A new command line registration tool ovirt-register-sso-client-tool has been added that can be used to register new sso clients. <br><br>On running the tool user is prompted to enter the client id, callback prefix and the certificate location. A new entry is created in the sso_clients table if one does not exist or the existing one with the same client id is updated. The client_secret which is written to a temporary file should be noted and used by the client. <br><br>The client secret in the sso_clients table is in encrypted format and is for sso internal use only.
 - [BZ 1463083](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1463083) <b>RESTAPI - Attaching a storage domain to 4.0 DC fails due to discard after delete is now True by default but not supported</b><br>When adding a new data storage domain without stating the values of Discard After Delete (DAD) and storage format, their default values used to be calculated according to the data center version of the host that added the storage domain:<br>DAD = true for dc >= 4.1, otherwise false.<br>Storage format = V4 for dc >= 4.1, otherwise V3.<br><br>This was a bad heuristic since the dc of the host that added the domain is a random dc and is not necessarily the dc that the domain will be later attached to.<br><br>Therefore, the logic was changed to be as follows:<br>- The default storage format for new data domains will be the latest format (now it is V4). For non data domains, nothing has changed here - V1 was and will remain the default value.<br>- The default value of DAD will be calculated according to the storage format: true for >= V4 and otherwise false.
 - [BZ 1420310](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1420310) <b>User actions should succeed regardless of 'filter' parameter</b><br>The API supports the 'filter' parameter to indicate if results should be filtered according to the permissions of the user. Due to the way this is implemented, non admin users need to set this parameter for almost all operations, as the default value is 'false'. To simplify things for non admin users, this patch changes the default value to 'true', but only for non admin users. If the value is explicitly given in a request it will be honored.<br>    <br>This is a backwards compatibility breaking change, as clients that used non admin users and did *not* provide explicitly the 'filter' parameter will start to behave differently. However, this is unlikely, as calls from non admin users without the 'filter=true' is almost useless. For those unlikely cases where this may be a problem, the patch also introduces a new 'ENGINE_API_FILTER_BY_DEFAULT' configuration parameter:<br>    <br>  #<br>  # This flags indicates if 'filtering' should be enabled by default for<br>  # users that aren't administrators.<br>  #<br>  ENGINE_API_FILTER_BY_DEFAULT="true"<br>    <br>If it is necessary to revert to the behaviour of previous versions of the engine, it can be achieved by changing this parameter in a configuration file inside the '/etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d' directory. For<br>example:<br>    <br>  # echo 'ENGINE_API_FILTER_BY_DEFAULT="false"' > \<br>  /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/99-filter-by-default.conf<br>    <br>  # systemctl restart ovirt-engine

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1460609](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1460609) <b>Introduce ovirt-host package</b><br>A new package ovirt-host has been introduced, consolidating oVirt Host package requirements to a single meta package.

#### OTOPI

 - [BZ 1411100](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1411100) <b>[RFE] Change timestamp format to include timezone for logs</b><br>From now on, all timestamp records for otopi-based tools logs - including engine-setup, host-deploy, hosted-engine --deploy - will contain a time zone to ease correlation between logs on the Manager and hosts. They will also now include the fraction of a second. Previously they contained a timestamp without a time zone and fraction of a second, for example:<br><br>2017-04-03 09:56:58 DEBUG otopi.context context.dumpEnvironment:760 ENVIRONMENT DUMP - BEGIN<br><br>From now on there will always be a comma and fraction of second after the seconds part, and a timezone identifier at the end of the timestamp part, for example:<br><br>2017-04-05 10:41:08,500+0300 DEBUG otopi.context context.dumpEnvironment:760 ENVIRONMENT DUMP - BEGIN

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1205739](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1205739) <b>[RFE][DR] - Allow recovering an imported domain without an UP DC</b><br>Cause: <br><br>Consequence: <br><br>Fix: <br><br>Result:
 - [BZ 1391859](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1391859) <b>[RFE] When creating thick allocated disks on file-based storage, use '-o preallocation=falloc' instead of 'dd' with zeros.</b><br>Feature: Time required to create thick allocated disks on file-based storage was greatly improved.<br><br>Reason: Old approach was to write zeroes to fill the file using dd command. Now we use posix_fallocate(3) to ensures that disk space is allocated.<br><br>Result: Thick allocated volumes are created much faster now. In extreme case 1gb volume creation time reduced from 61 seconds to less then a second.
 - [BZ 1228543](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1228543) <b>[RFE] hot-unplug memory</b><br>Memory hot-unplug feature is documented at<br>https://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/hot-unplug-memory/<br><br>When documenting the feature, please note that memory hot-unplug functionality places certain requirements on memory hot-plug. Those requirements should be mentioned not only in the memory hot-unplug documentation but also in the memory hot-plug documentation.
 - [BZ 1334982](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1334982) <b>[RFE] Gracefully shutdown Virtual Machines on Host reboot/shutdown.</b><br>Feature: <br>Gracefully shutdown the running VMs on host shutdown.<br><br>Reason: <br>Without this feature the running VMs are killed by the systemd process. Killed VMs are not given any chance to finish proper shutdown, thus resulting in undefined states.<br>Undefined state results in undesirable scenarios, especially for VMs running databases, eg Oracle, SAP ...<br><br>Result: <br>The graceful shutdown takes care of running VMs by holding the systemd and telling VMs to shutdown properly. After VMs are shutdown, the systemd is allowed to take over control and continue shutdown.<br>The VDSM is shutdown after the graceful shutdown of VMs.<br>Before that VDSM passes information to the engine and waits for for (default, can be changed in vdsm.conf) 5s for the engine to ACK VMs shutdown.
 - [BZ 1168327](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1168327) <b>Live Merge: optimize internal volume size</b><br>Feature: <br>Reduce (base) volume size to optimal after live merge.<br><br>Reason: <br>During live merge, the base volume is extended to accommodate merging the top volume into it.<br><br>Result: <br>A new verb, ReduceVolue, is now called at the of live merge to reduce (base) volume size to optimal.
 - [BZ 1430799](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1430799) <b>Create script to restore original network configuration of removed vdsm host</b><br>Feature:<br>Provide tools for simple removal of networks configured by oVirt on a host.<br><br>Reason: <br>One could add a host into Engine and one minute later decide to remove it. But the host would have ovirtmgmt bridge and various VDSM network hacks which are not clear how to remove.<br><br>Result:<br>vdsm-tool now provides commands for VDSM network cleanup, particularly `vdsm-tool clear-nets` and `vdsm-tool dummybr-remove`. One could remove networks configured by VDSM following the steps below. Note that vdsm service is not required to be running:<br><br>1. To prevent loss of connectivity it might be needed to exclude default route network from cleanup. Look for a network providing default route (ovirtmgmt by defalut):<br># vdsm-tool list-nets<br>...<br>ovirtmgmt (default route)<br>...<br><br>2. Remove all networks configured by VDSM except for the default network.<br># vdsm-tool clear-nets --exlude-net ovirtmgmt<br><br>3. Remove libvirt dummy bridge ;vdsmdummy;<br># vdsm-tool dummybr-remove<br><br>4. Host should be clean, you can remove vdsm now.
 - [BZ 1367806](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1367806) <b>[RFE] - Add "blkdiscard" as a new method to zero volumes</b><br>This feature adds a new parameter to the VDSM config file: "zero_method".<br><br>When removing a disk/snapshot on block storage where wipe after delete is enabled, a vdsm host will zero the disk/snapshot using the zero method specified in its config file (in /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf).<br>The options are:<br>- blkdiscard - uses a "blkdiscard --zeroout" command.<br>- dd - uses a "dd" command (currently the default option).<br><br>Note that blkdiscard is more efficient than dd, in particular when the underlying storage supports "write same".
 - [BZ 1335642](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1335642) <b>[RFE] Users should be able to seal VMs from RHEV-M</b><br>The feature is documented here: http://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/virt-sysprep/

#### imgbased

 - [BZ 1420068](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1420068) <b>[RFE] RHV-H should meet NIST 800-53 partitioning requirements by default</b><br>Feature: RHV-H supports the NIST 800-53 partitioning requirements.<br><br>Reason: In order to improve the security of RHV-H, NIST provides useful guidelines for common configurations. <br><br>Result: As a first step, RHV-H uses a NIST 800-53 partition layout by default, and existing configurations will changed to match on update.

#### oVirt Engine SDK 4 Python

 - [BZ 1483305](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1483305) <b>[RFE] - Streaming API should support download of disk snapshots</b><br>Added the ability to download disk's snapshots using the rest-api.<br>The REST API Guide should be updated (IMAGETRANSFER section [1]), and should include a reference to the sdk example [2].<br><br>[1] https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.1/html-single/rest_api_guide/#services-image_transfer<br><br>[2] https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-sdk/blob/master/sdk/examples/download_disk_snapshots.py

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1459134](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1459134) <b>[RFE] Rebase engine-setup on PostgreSQL >= 9.5</b><br>Feature: <br><br>The engine now requires PostgreSQL 9.5 or later.<br><br>engine-setup can help upgrade an existing database to Software Collections PostgreSQL 9.5, as well as use that version for new setups.<br><br>Reason: <br><br>Better performance and new features (to be partially used as described in other bugzilla bugs).<br><br>Result: <br><br>The engine in 4.2 is faster and more efficient.
 - [BZ 1185782](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1185782) <b>REST-API is missing image total size attribute</b><br>
 - [BZ 1205739](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1205739) <b>[RFE][DR] - Allow recovering an imported domain without an UP DC</b><br>Cause: <br><br>Consequence: <br><br>Fix: <br><br>Result:
 - [BZ 1459908](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1459908) <b>Rest API does not report network statistics host "data.current.tx, data.current.rx"</b><br>Feature: <br><br>The precision of the rx_rate, tx_rate, rx_drop and tx_drop of virtual and host network interfaces is increased.<br><br>Reason: <br><br>If traffic on the network interface is below the precision of the network interface statistics, it is not reflected in the statistics.<br><br>Result: <br><br>This enables to detect 100 times smaller traffic on network interface statistics.
 - [BZ 1483305](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1483305) <b>[RFE] - Streaming API should support download of disk snapshots</b><br>Added the ability to download disk's snapshots using the rest-api.<br>The REST API Guide should be updated (IMAGETRANSFER section [1]), and should include a reference to the sdk example [2].<br><br>[1] https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.1/html-single/rest_api_guide/#services-image_transfer<br><br>[2] https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-sdk/blob/master/sdk/examples/download_disk_snapshots.py
 - [BZ 1096497](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1096497) <b>[restapi] Display image size and type for glance images missing in RESTAPI</b><br>Feature: <br>before that feature, Glance images returned by RESTAPI didn't list their size and type (iso/disk).<br><br>Reason: <br>That information should be listed regarding to Glance images.<br><br>Result:<br>Glance images do list their type and size on REST API.
 - [BZ 1372163](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1372163) <b>[RFE] Warn user about VMs that have pending snapshot removal retries</b><br>Feature: <br>When live or cold merge fails, snapshot disks may be illegal. In this case, we add exclamation mark next to those VMs names.<br><br>Reason:<br>Shutting down VMs with illegal snapshot disks, will end up in not being able to start those VMs again.<br><br>Result: <br>Exclamation mark appears next to the VMs with illegal snapshot disks.
 - [BZ 1463633](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1463633) <b>[RFE] Provide support for data aggregation when fetching entities</b><br>Feature: <br><br>API Link Following. This features enable oVirt API users to request that the contents of some of the entity's links be returned inline, inside the requested entity.<br><br>Reason: <br><br>Currently when there is the need to retrieve multiple related objects from the API the only alternative is to retrieve the first one, and then, send additional requests to retrieve the related objects. For example, if you need a virtual machine and also the disks and NICs you need first to send a request like this:<br><br>GET /ovirt-engine/api/vms/123<br><br>And then additional requests to get the disk attachments, the disks, and the NICs:<br><br>GET /ovirt-engine/api/vms/123/diskattachments GET /ovirt-engine/api/disks/456 GET /ovirt-engine/api/disks/789 GET /ovirt-engine/api/vms/123/nics<br><br>In an environment with high latency this multiplies the time required to retrieve the data. In addition it also means that multiple queries have to be sent to the database to retrieve the data.<br><br>In order to improve in these two areas the new follow parameter will be introduced. This parameter will be a list of links that the server should follow and populate. For example, the previous scenario will be solved sending this request:<br><br>GET /ovirt-engine/api/vms/123?follow=diskattachments.disks,nics<br><br>That will return the virtual machine with the disks and the NICs embedded in the same response, thus avoiding the multiple network round-trips.<br><br>The multiple database queries will be avoided only if the server is modified to retrieve that data with more efficient queries, otherwise the server will use the naive approach of calling itself to retrieve it, which won’t improve the number of queries.<br><br>Result: <br><br>This features saves the need from client-side scripts for following links and enables running designated queries for common scenarios (e.g: get vms+nics+disks)<br><br>Deep dive presentation: <br><br>  https://bluejeans.com/s/Xdsmj
 - [BZ 1416491](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1416491) <b>[RFE] Add support for OpenID Connect in engine SSO</b><br>Add engine SSO support for OpenId Connect clients. New OpenId Connect discovery endpoint https://<ENGINE>/ovirt-engine/sso/openid/.well-known/openid-configuration has been added so clients can discover the authorization endpoints and OpenId Connect capabilities of engine.<br><br>https://<ENGINE>/ovirt-engine/sso/openid/authorize endpoint is used for client authorization and obtaining the authentication code.<br><br>https://<ENGINE>/ovirt-engine/sso/openid/token endpoint is used by clients to obtain the authentication token from the authentication code.<br><br>https://<ENGINE>/ovirt-engine/sso/openid/userinfo endpoint can used by clients to get details of the logged in user.<br><br>https://<ENGINE>/ovirt-engine/sso/openid/jwks endpoint can used by clients to get the keys used by SSO to sign the id_token returned from token and tokeninfo endpoints.

### Known Issue

#### imgbased

 - [BZ 1454536](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1454536) <b>HostedEngine setup fails if RHV-H timezone < UTC set during installation</b><br>Cause: RHV-H generates vdsm certificates at the time of first boot.<br><br>Consequence: If the system clock is not set correctly at install time, chrony or ntpd may resynchronize the clock after the vdsm certificate is generated, leading to a certificate which is not valid yet if the appropriate timezone is behind UTC.<br><br>Workaround (if any): Set the system clock appropriately at install time. imgbased-configure-vdsm will now start after chronyd/ntpd and wait 2 seconds for the clock to sync, but this is not a guarantee.
