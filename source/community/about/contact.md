# Communication

There are a number of ways to communicate with the oVirt Community.
[Mailing lists](/community/about/mailing-lists.html), [IRC](#irc), our [bug tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt) and [oVirt GitHub](https://github.com/oVirt).

## IRC

We are on **irc.oftc.net** server on **#ovirt** channel.

## Bug tracker and code review

You can report bugs, or discuss possible solutions to issues, on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt) and [oVirt GitHub](https://github.com/oVirt).

We use GitHub to review patches.
If you are not familiar with the process, you can read about
[collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
on the GitHub website.
