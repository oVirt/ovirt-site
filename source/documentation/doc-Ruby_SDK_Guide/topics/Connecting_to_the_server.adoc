[id="Connecting_to_the_server"]
= Connecting to the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}

The `Connection` class is the entry point of the software development kit. It provides access to the services of the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}'s REST API.

The parameters of the `Connection` class are:

* `url` - Base URL of the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} API
* `username`
* `password`
* `ca_file` - PEM file containing the trusted CA certificates. The `ca.pem` file is required when connecting to a server protected by TLS. If you do not specify the `ca_file`, the system-wide CA certificate store is used.

connection.close

The connection, and all the services obtained from it, cannot be used after the connection has been closed.

If the connection fails, the software development kit will raise an link:http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ovirt-engine-sdk/OvirtSDK4/Error[Error] exception, containing details of the failure.
