==== Migrating Storage Domains between Data Centers in Different Environments

Migrate a storage domain from one {virt-product-fullname} environment to another
to allow the destination environment to access the data contained in the storage domain.
This procedure involves removing the storage domain from one {virt-product-fullname} environment,
and importing it into a different environment.
To import and attach an existing data storage domain to a {virt-product-fullname} data center,
the storage domain's source data center must have the correct supported compatibility level.

[WARNING]
====
Migrating a data storage domain to a data center that has a higher compatibility level than the original data center upgrades the storage domain’s storage format version.
====

If you want to move the storage domain back to the original data center for any reason, such as to migrate virtual machines to the new data center, be aware that the higher version prevents reattaching the data storage domain to the original data center.

The Administration Portal prompts you to confirm that you want to update the storage domain format, for example, from *V3* to *V5*. It also warns that you will not be able to attach it back to an older data center with a lower DC level.

To work around this issue, you can create a target data center that has the same compatibility version as the source data center. When you no longer need to maintain the lower compatibility version, you can increase the target data center’s compatibility version.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Administration Portal of the source environment.
. Shut down all virtual machines running on the required storage domain.
. Click menu:Storage[Domains].
. Click the storage domain's name. This opens the details view.
. Click the *Data Center* tab.
. Click *Maintenance*, then click btn:[OK].
. Click *Detach*, then click btn:[OK].
. Click *Remove*.
. In the *Remove Storage(s)* window, ensure the *Format Domain, i.e. Storage Content will be lost!* check box is not selected. This step preserves the data in the storage domain for later use.
. Click btn:[OK] to remove the storage domain from the source environment.
. Log in to the Administration Portal of the destination environment.
. Click menu:Storage[Domains].
. Click *Import Domain*.
. Select the destination data center from the *Data Center* drop-down list.
. Enter a name for the storage domain.
. Select the *Domain Function* and *Storage Type* from the appropriate drop-down lists.
. Select a host from the *Host* drop-down list.
. Enter the details of the storage domain.
+
[NOTE]
====
The fields for specifying the details of the storage domain change depending on the value you select in the *Storage Type* drop-down list. These fields are the same as those available for adding a new storage domain.
====
+
. Select the *Activate Domain in Data Center* check box to automatically activate the storage domain when it is attached.
. Click btn:[OK].

The storage domain is attached to the destination data center in the new {virt-product-fullname} environment and is automatically activated. You can now import virtual machines and templates from the imported storage domain to the destination data center.

[WARNING]
====
Upon attaching a Storage Domain to the destination Data-Center,
it may be upgraded to a newer Storage Domain format and may not re-attach to the source Data-Center.
This breaks the use of a Data-Domain as a replacement for Export Domains.
