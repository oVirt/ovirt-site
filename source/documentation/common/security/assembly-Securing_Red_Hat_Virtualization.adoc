// This assembly is included in the following assemblies:

// In case RHV 4.4 restores support for DISA STIG, am commenting-out (not removing) "include::" statements from the following four assembly files that include this topic.
// assembly-Installing_Red_Hat_Virtualization_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_Cockpit_web_interface/master.adoc
// assembly-Installing_Red_Hat_Virtualization_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/master.adoc

ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='my-assembly-a']
// * Title: = My assembly A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id='security']
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules-{context}'].
= Securing {virt-product-fullname}
//If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.
:context: assembly-securing-rhv
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

This topic includes limited information about how to secure {virt-product-fullname}. This information will increase over time.

This information is specific to {virt-product-fullname}; it and does not cover fundamental security practices related to:

* Disabling unnecessary services
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Accounting
* Penetration testing and hardening of non-RHV services
* Encryption of sensitive application data

.Prerequisites

* You should be proficient in your organization's security standards and practices. If possible, consult with your organization's Security Officer.
* Consult the {enterprise-linux} link:{URL_rhel_docs_legacy}html-single/security_guide/index[Security Guide] before deploying {enterprise-linux-host-shortname}s.
