# Localization Mini-Howto

This is a short howto on localizing the ovirt engine user interface. Intended primary audience: translators:

1.  create a [Fedora Authentication System](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/) (FAS) user
2.  Go to [Zanata](https://translate.zanata.org/) and login using your FAS account - Optionally you can login with your Google, Yahoo, or any other OpenID account and merge accounts, so that you do not need the FAS account anymore
3.  Request to join your language group, this usually takes a few hours or up to a day
4.  Send an email to [User:Ecohen](Einav Cohen) (ecohen at red hat dot com) and ask her to add your language to the ovirt project
5.  As soon as you joined your language-group and oVirt has that language added, you can start translating on the [Zanata web interface](https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/project/view/ovirt).
