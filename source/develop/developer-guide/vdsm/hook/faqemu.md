# faqemu

Enables the Fake QEMU support, used mainly for testing - to run vdsm on virtual machines that do not have VT/AMD-V extensions.

This requires a setting in /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf

      fake_kvm_support = True

ovirt-host-deploy should be told not to overwrite this setting. See [ovirt-host-deploy README](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-host-deploy.git;a=blob;f=README;hb=HEAD#l52) on how to do that.

No requirement for a custom property
