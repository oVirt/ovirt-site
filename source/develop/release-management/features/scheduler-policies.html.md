### Getting Started with Scheduler Policies

This is the easiest explanation to active an internal scheduler policy.

#### Create scheduling policy

*   Enter the "Administrator portal".
*   Click "configure"(At the top right edge of the screen). A dialog should open.
*   Click the tab "Scheduling policies" at the left side of the dialog.
*   Click "new" and create a new policy(Giving a name is enough in order to create A non-filtering policy).
*   Close the dialog.

#### Attach scheduling policy to a cluster

*   Click the "Clusters" tab.
*   Click a cluster to attach the policy to, from the table below("Default" cluster is fine).
*   Click "edit". A dialog should open.
*   Click "Scheduling Policy" on the left tab from the dialog.
*   In the "Select Policy" combo-box choose the name you gave the policy eariler.

Now the scheduling policy is attached to the cluster you choose and it's working.

### Current status of filter and weight policies
