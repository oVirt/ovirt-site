= Manually installing the {engine-appliance-name}

When you deploy the self-hosted engine, the following sequence of events takes place:

. The installer installs the {engine-appliance-name} to the deployment host.
. The appliance installs the {engine-name} virtual machine.
. The appliance installs the {engine-name} on the {engine-name} virtual machine.

However, you can install the appliance manually on the deployment host beforehand if you need to. The appliance is large and network connectivity issues might cause the appliance installation to take a long time, or possibly fail.

.Procedure

To install the {engine-appliance-name} to the host manually, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# yum install {engine-package}-appliance
----

Now, when you deploy the self-hosted engine, the installer detects that the appliance is already installed.
