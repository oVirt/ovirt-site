## Detailed Description

[Affinity labels](/documentation/sla/affinity-labels) were introduced in version 4.0, but could only be managed via the REST API. This feature allows users to manage their labels without ever leaving the the administration portal UI.

### Affinity Label Detail Tabs

An affinity labels detail tab has been added to the clusters, virtual machines, and hosts main views. They can be accessed by clicking on the name of any entity from the main view and click on "Affinity Labels".

The detail tabs for the virtual machines and hosts main views display the labels that have been assigned to the currently selected entity. For the moment, the clusters detail tab displays all labels in the system. In the future, the plan is to only display labels associated with the selected cluster.
