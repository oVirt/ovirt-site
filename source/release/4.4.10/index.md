# oVirt 4.4.10 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.10.2 release as of March 03, 2022.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5 (or similar) and CentOS Stream.

> **NOTE**
>
> Starting from oVirt 4.4.6 both oVirt Node and oVirt Engine Appliance are
> based on CentOS Stream.

Please note that if you are upgrading oVirt Node from previous version you should remove CentOS Linux related yum configuration.
See Bug [1955617 - CentOS Repositories should be removed from yum.repo.d when upgrading to CentOS Stream](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955617)

## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.10 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.10 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.10).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.10?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 2044257](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2044257) **Bump snmp4j library version to remove dependency on log4j**

   In this release, oVirt 4.4.10 requires snmp4j version 3.6.4 or later, which no longer depends on the log4j library.

 - [BZ 2007286](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007286) **Host is never fenced after a soft fence attempt**

   Previously, a non-responding host was first soft-fenced by the Engine, but this did not fix the connectivity issue. The engine did not initiate a hard fence and the host was left in an non-responding state.

In this release, soft fencing has been fixed so that if the soft fencing does not make the host responsive again, then the non-responding host treatment process continues correctly with the additional steps.


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1897114](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1897114) **Add additional logging information to be able to understand why host is stuck in Unassigned state**

   In this release, monitoring of host refresh capabilities functionality was improved to help debug very rare production issues that sometimes caused the oVirt Engine to lose connectivity with the oVirt Node hosts.


### Removed functionality

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 2044277](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2044277) **Replace ovirt-engine-extension-logger-log4j with internal ovirt-engine implementation**

   With this release, the ovirt-engine-extension-logger-log4j package has been removed. It is replaced by an internal ovirt-engine implementation. 



When upgrading from earlier oVirt versions to oVirt 4.4.10, the ovirt-engine-extension-logger-log4j package is uninstalled if it is present. If you used the ovirt-engine-extension-logger-log4j in earlier oVirt versions, you must manually remove the ovirt-engine-extension-logger-log4j configuration files and configure the new feature for sending log records to a remote syslog service, as outlined in the Administration Guide.



After a successful upgrade to oVirt 4.4.10, you can uninstall log4j12 without breaking the oVirt setup by running the following command: `$ dnf remove log4j12`.
