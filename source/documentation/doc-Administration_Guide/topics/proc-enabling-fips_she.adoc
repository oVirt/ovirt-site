= Enabling FIPS in a self-hosted engine

You can enable FIPS in a self-hosted engine during deployment when using the command-line.

.Procedure

. Start the self-hosted engine deployment script. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/index[Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a self-hosted engine using the command line].
. When the deployment script prompts `Do you want to apply a default OpenSCAP security profile?`, enter `Yes`
. Follow the on-screen instructions to select *`VPP - Protection Profile for Virtualization 1.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Hypervisor (RHELH)`*.

.Verification

Verify that FIPS is enabled by entering the command `fips-mode-setup --check` on the host. The command should return `FIPS mode is enabled`:
