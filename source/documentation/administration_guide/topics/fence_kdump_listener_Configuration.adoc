[id="fence_kdump_listener_Configuration"]
= fence_kdump listener Configuration

Edit the configuration of the fence_kdump listener. This is only necessary in cases where the default configuration is not sufficient.


.Procedure

. Create a new file (for example, *my-fence-kdump.conf*) in */etc/ovirt-engine/ovirt-fence-kdump-listener.conf.d/*.
. Enter your customization with the syntax _OPTION_=_value_ and save the file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The edited values must also be changed in `engine-config` as outlined in the fence_kdump Listener Configuration Options table in xref:Configuring_fence_kdump_on_the_Manager[].
====
+
. Restart the fence_kdump listener:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl restart ovirt-fence-kdump-listener.service
