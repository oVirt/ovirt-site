= Storage Considerations

The storage domain for {virt-product-fullname} can comprise either block devices (SAN - iSCSI or FCP) or a file system (NAS - NFS, GlusterFS, or other POSIX compliant file systems). For more information about {virt-product-fullname} storage, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#chap-Storage[Storage] in the _Administration Guide_.

The sites require synchronously replicated storage that is writeable on both sites with shared layer 2 (L2) network connectivity. The replicated storage is required to allow virtual machines to migrate between sites and continue running on the siteâ€™s storage. All storage replication options supported by {enterprise-linux} 7 and later can be used in the stretch cluster.

If you have a custom multipath configuration that is recommended by the storage vendor, see the instructions and important limitations in link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_self-hosted_engine_using_the_command_line/index#proc-Customizing_Multipath_Configurations_for_SAN_Vendors_SHE_cli_deploy[Customizing Multipath Configurations for SAN Vendors].

Set the SPM role on a host at the primary site to have precedence. To do so, configure SPM priority as high in the primary site hosts and SPM priority as low on secondary site hosts. If you have a primary site failure that impacts network devices inside the primary site, preventing the fencing device for the SPM host from being reachable, such as power loss, the hosts in the seconday site are not able to take over the SPM role.

In such a scenario virtual machines do a failover, but operations that require the SPM role in place cannot be executed, including adding new disks, extending existing disks, and exporting virtual machines.

To restore full functionality, detect the actual nature of the disaster and after fixing the root cause and rebooting the SPM host, select *Confirm 'Host has been Rebooted'* for the SPM host.
