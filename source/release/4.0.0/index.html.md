 - [BZ 1270581](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1270581) <b>[RFE] Hostdev_passthrough: support SCSI FC tape device</b><br>Previously, oVirt/RHEV only allowed hostdev passthrough of USB and PCI devices. To assign storage cards directly to VM, users had to assign the whole adapter as PCI device. The problem with this approach is that PCI passthrough has specific hardware requirements.<br><br>This feature allows administrators to passthrough a LUN directly to a VM, allowing for full set of SG commands - meaning tapes, changers and anything speaking SCSI protocol can be assigned directly, without specific hardware requirements (except for assigned device itself).
