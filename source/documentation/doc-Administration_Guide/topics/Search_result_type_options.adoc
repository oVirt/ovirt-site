=== Search Result Type Options

The result type allows you to search for resources of any of the following types:


* *Vms* for a list of virtual machines

* *Host* for a list of hosts

* *Pools* for a list of pools

* *Template* for a list of templates

* *Events* for a list of events

* *Users* for a list of users

* *Cluster* for a list of clusters

* *DataCenter* for a list of data centers

* *Storage* for a list of storage domains

As each type of resource has a unique set of properties and a set of other resource types that it is associated with, each search type has a set of valid syntax combinations. You can also use the auto-complete feature to create valid queries easily.
