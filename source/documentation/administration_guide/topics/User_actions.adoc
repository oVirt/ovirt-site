==== User Actions

For an action to be successfully performed, the *user* must have the appropriate *permission* for the *object* being acted upon. Each type of action has a corresponding *permission*.

Some actions are performed on more than one object. For example, copying a template to another storage domain will impact both the template and the destination storage domain. The user performing an action must have appropriate permissions for all objects the action impacts.
