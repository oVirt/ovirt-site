# oVirt 4.4.7 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.7 Third Release Candidate as of June 10, 2021.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 (or similar) and CentOS Stream.

> **NOTE**
>
> Starting from oVirt 4.4.6 both oVirt Node and oVirt Engine Appliance are
> based on CentOS Stream.

{:.alert.alert-warning}
Please note that if you are upgrading oVirt Node from previous version you should remove CentOS Linux related yum configuration.
See Bug [1955617 - CentOS Repositories should be removed from yum.repo.d when upgrading to CentOS Stream](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955617)

## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.7 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.7 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.7).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.7?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine WildFly

 - [BZ 1938101](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1938101) **Rebase on Wildfly 23**

   oVirt Engine now requires WildFly 23


#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1966574](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1966574) **Update the required Grafana to 7.3 in ovirt-dwh**

   Required Grafana version changed from 6.7 to 7.3.


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1963748](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1963748) **[RFE] Upgrade to EAP 7.4 in RHV 4.4.7**

   RHV 4.4.7 now requires EAP 7.4

 - [BZ 1966145](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1966145) **Remove version lock on specific ansible version and require ansible 2.9.z &gt;= 2.9.21 in ovirt-engine**

   ovirt-engine in RHV 4.4.7 requires ansible 2.9.z higher than 2.9.20. Also in RHV 4.4.7 version for specific ansible version has been removed, because correct ansible version shipped in RHV channels.

 - [BZ 1938101](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1938101) **Rebase on Wildfly 23**

   oVirt Engine now requires WildFly 23


#### ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap

 - [BZ 1964522](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1964522) **Allow both automatic detection of IP version available as well as manual configuration**

   To solve issues in mixed Pv4/IPv6 setups following changes has been done:



1. A new option pool.default.socketfactory.resolver.detectIPVersion

   to enable/disable automatic detection of IP protocol has been

   introduced:

    - By default set to true

    - Automatic detection of IP versions has been improved to use

      the default gateway IP addresses (if a default gateway has

      IPv4/IPv6 address, A/AAAA DNS records are used to resolve LDAP

      servers FQDNs)

    - If automatic detection is disabled, then administrators need

      to set properly below options according to their network setup



2. A new option pool.default.socketfactory.resolver.supportIPv4

   to enable/disable usage of IPv4 has been introduced:

    - By default set to false (automatic detection is preferred)

    - If set to true, type "A" DNS records are used to resolve LDAP

      servers FQDNs

   

3. Existing option pool.default.socketfactory.resolver.supportIPv6

   is used to enable/disable usage of IPv6

    - By default set to false (in previous versions it was enabled)

    - If set to true, type "AAAA" DNS records are used to resolve

      LDAP servers FQDNs



So by default automatic detection of IP version using the default gateway addresses is used, which should work for most of the setups. If there is some special mixed IPv4/IPv6 setup, where automatic detection fails, then it's needed to turn off automatic detection and configure IP versions manually as a part of /etc/ovirt-engine/aaa/&lt;PROFILE&gt;.properties configuration for specific LDAP setup.


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1948418](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1948418) **[RFE] Add memory, and CPU sizes to Hosts/Virtual Machines Trend dashboard**

   Feature: 

added to hosts and vms trend dashboards 2 panels. one withe the total memory size, and one with the total cpu cores.

 - [BZ 1849685](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1849685) **[RFE] Handle PKI renew for grafana**

   engine-setup now allows renewing the certificate also for grafana when it is set up on a separate machine from the engine.

 - [BZ 1952424](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1952424) **[RFE]  Add Data Source variable to all dashboards**

   Feature: Add the option to select Data Source for all dashboards.



Reason: 

This way we can navigate easily if there are several different engines (with different dwh).


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1958081](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1958081) **[RFE] Enable ramfb for mdev with display=on**

   When a vGPU is used and nodisplay is not specified, an additional framebuffer display device is added to the VM now, allowing to display the VM console before the vGPU is initialized. This allows display console access during boot, instead of having just a blank screen there as before this change.



This works only on cluster levels &gt;= 4.5. It is possible to disable the feature by setting VgpuFramebufferSupported Engine config value to false.

 - [BZ 1913789](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1913789) **[RFE] Support RHEL 9 guests**
