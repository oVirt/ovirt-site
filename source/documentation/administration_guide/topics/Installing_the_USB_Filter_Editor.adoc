==== Installing the USB Filter Editor

The USB Filter Editor is a Windows tool used to configure the *usbfilter.txt* policy file. The policy rules defined in this file allow or deny automatic passthrough of specific USB devices from client machines to virtual machines managed using the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. The policy file resides on the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} in the following location:
*/etc/ovirt-engine/usbfilter.txt*
Changes to USB filter policies do not take effect unless the *ovirt-engine* service on the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} is restarted.

Download the *USB Filter Editor* installer from link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/415/[this "Installers and Images for {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}"] topic.


*Installing the USB Filter Editor*

. On a Windows machine, extract the *.msi* intaller from the *.zip* file and run the *.msi* installer.
. Follow the steps of the installation wizard. Unless otherwise specified, the USB Filter Editor will be installed by default in either *C:\Program Files\RedHat\USB Filter Editor* or *C:\Program Files(x86)\RedHat\USB Filter Editor* depending on your version of Windows.
. A USB Filter Editor shortcut icon is created on your desktop.



[IMPORTANT]
====
Use a Secure Copy (SCP) client to import and export filter policies from the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. A Secure Copy tool for Windows machines is WinSCP (link:http://winscp.net[]).
====
The default USB device policy provides virtual machines with basic access to USB devices; update the policy to allow the use of additional USB devices.
