== Migrating virtual machines from the self-hosted engine host

Only the {engine-name} virtual machine should remain on the host until after you have finished upgrading the host. Migrate any virtual machines other than the {engine-name} virtual machine to another host in the same cluster.

You can use Live Migration to minimize virtual machine down-time. For more information, see
link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#sect-Migrating_Virtual_Machines_Between_Hosts[Migrating Virtual Machines Between Hosts] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_ for more information.

include::common/she/snip-Enabling_Global_Maintenance_Mode.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

You can now update the {engine-name} to the latest version of 4.3.

include::common/upgrade/proc-Updating_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

You can now upgrade the {engine-name} to 4.4.

include::common/upgrade/proc-Upgrading_the_Manager_to_4-4.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// Add new {engine-name} upgrade versions here

You can now update the self-hosted engine nodes, and then any standard hosts. The procedure is the same for both host types.
