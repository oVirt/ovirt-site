=== Search Auto-Completion

The Administration Portal provides auto-completion to help you create valid and powerful search queries. As you type each part of a search query, a drop-down list of choices for the next part of the search opens below the Search Bar. You can either select from the list and then continue typing/selecting the next part of the search, or ignore the options and continue entering your query manually.

The following table specifies by example how the Administration Portal auto-completion assists in constructing a query:

`Hosts: Vms.status = down`
