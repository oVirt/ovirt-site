=== Configuring Single Sign-On for Virtual Machines

Configuring single sign-on, also known as password delegation, allows you to automatically log in to a virtual machine using the credentials you use to log in to the VM Portal. Single sign-on can be used on both {enterprise-linux} and Windows virtual machines.

[NOTE]
====
Single sign-on is not supported for virtual machines running {enterprise-linux} 8.0.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
If single sign-on to the VM Portal is enabled, single sign-on to virtual machines will not be possible. With single sign-on to the VM Portal enabled, the VM Portal does not need to accept a password, thus the password cannot be delegated to sign in to virtual machines.

[[sect-Configuring_USB_Devices]]
=== Configuring USB Devices

A virtual machine connected with the SPICE protocol can be configured to connect directly to USB devices.

The USB device will only be redirected if the virtual machine is active, in focus and is run from the VM Portal. USB redirection can be manually enabled each time a device is plugged in or set to automatically redirect to active virtual machines in the Console Options window.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note the distinction between the client machine and guest machine. The client is the hardware from which you access a guest. The guest is the virtual desktop or virtual server which is accessed through the VM Portal or Administration Portal.
====

USB redirection *Enabled* mode allows KVM/SPICE USB redirection for Linux and Windows virtual machines. Virtual (guest) machines require no guest-installed agents or drivers for native USB. On {enterprise-linux} clients, all packages required for USB redirection are provided by the `virt-viewer` package. On Windows clients, you must also install the `usbdk` package. Enabled USB mode is supported on the following clients and guests:

[NOTE]
====
If you have a 64-bit architecture PC, you must use the 64-bit version of Internet Explorer to install the 64-bit version of the USB driver. The USB redirection will not work if you install the 32-bit version on a 64-bit architecture. As long as you initially install the correct USB type, you can access USB redirection from both 32- and 64-bit browsers.

=== Configuring Console Options

[[sect-Console_Options]]
==== Console Options

Connection protocols are the underlying technology used to provide graphical consoles for virtual machines and allow users to work with virtual machines in a similar way as they would with physical machines. {virt-product-fullname} currently supports the following connection protocols:

*SPICE*

Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is the recommended connection protocol for both Linux virtual machines and Windows virtual machines. To open a console to a virtual machine using SPICE, use Remote Viewer.

*VNC*

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) can be used to open consoles to both Linux virtual machines and Windows virtual machines. To open a console to a virtual machine using VNC, use Remote Viewer or a VNC client.

*RDP*

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) can only be used to open consoles to Windows virtual machines, and is only available when you access a virtual machines from a Windows machine on which Remote Desktop has been installed. Before you can connect to a Windows virtual machine using RDP, you must set up remote sharing on the virtual machine and configure the firewall to allow remote desktop connections.

[NOTE]
====
SPICE is not supported on virtual machines running Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. If a virtual machine running one of these operating systems is configured to use the SPICE protocol, it detects the absence of the required SPICE drivers and runs in VGA compatibility mode.
