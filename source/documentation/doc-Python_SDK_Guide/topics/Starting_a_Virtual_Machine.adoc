You can start a virtual machine.

.Starting a virtual machine
====
This example starts the virtual machine using the `start` method.

*V4*

[source, Python]
----
import time
import ovirtsdk4 as sdk
import ovirtsdk4.types as types

connection = sdk.Connection(
    url='https://engine.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='password',
    ca_file='ca.pem',
)

# Get the reference to the "vms" service:
vms_service = connection.system_service().vms_service()

# Find the virtual machine:
vm = vms_service.list(search='name=vm1')[0]

# Locate the service that manages the virtual machine, as that is where
# the action methods are defined:
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)

# Call the "start" method of the service to start it:
vm_service.start()

# Wait until the virtual machine is up:
while True:
    time.sleep(5)
    vm = vm_service.get()
    if vm.status == types.VmStatus.UP:
        break

print("Started '%s'." % vm.name())

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()
----

If the `start` request is successful, the examples output the text:

[source,terminal]
----
Started 'vm1'.
----

The `UP` status indicates that the virtual machine is running.
