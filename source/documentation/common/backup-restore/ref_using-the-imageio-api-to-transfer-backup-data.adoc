= Using the imageio API to transfer backup data

[role="_abstract"]
Image transfer APIs start and stop an image transfer. The result is a
transfer URL.

You use the imageio API to actually transfer the data from the transfer URL.

For complete information on using the imageio API, see the link:http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-imageio/images.html[ovirt-imageio Images API reference].

.imageio Image API methods used in incremental backup and restore
[options="header"]
|===
|API request |Description |imageio Image API reference section
|`OPTIONS /images/{ticket-id} HTTP/1.1`
|Gets the server options, to find out what features the server supports.
|See _OPTIONS_

|`GET /images/{ticket-id}/extents`
|Gets information about disk image content and allocation, or about blocks that changed during an incremental backup. This information is known as _extent_ information.
|See _EXTENTS_

|`GET /images/{ticket-id}/extent?context=dirty`
|The program doing image transfer needs to download changes from the backup. These changes are know as dirty extents. To download changes, send a request like this:
|See _EXTENTS_-> _Examples_-> _Request dirty extents_

|`PUT /images/{ticket-id}`
|The backup application creates a new disk or a snapshot with an existing disk to hold the restored data.
|See _PUT_
