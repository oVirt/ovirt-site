= Creating an image transfer object for incremental backup

[role="_abstract"]
When the backup is ready to download, the backup application should create an `imagetransfer` object, which initiates a transfer for an incremental backup.

Creating an image transfer object requires a request call with a body.

.Procedure

. Send a request like this:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
POST /ovirt-engine/api/imagetransfers
----

. In the request body, specify the following parameters:
+
 ** disk id
 ** backup id
 ** direction of the disk set to `download`
 ** format of the disk set to `raw`
+
For example, to transfer a backup of a disk where the id of the disk is `123` and the id of the backup is `456`, send the following request body:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
<image_transfer>
    <disk id="123"/>
    <backup id="456"/>
    <direction>download</direction>
    <format>raw</format>
</image_transfer>
