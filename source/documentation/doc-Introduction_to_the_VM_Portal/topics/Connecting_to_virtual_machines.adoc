=== Connecting to virtual machines

*Connecting to a virtual machine*

. In the virtual machines pane, click *Run* in a virtual machine's card to start that virtual machine.

. Click *Console* to connect to the virtual machine.

. You will be asked to download a *.vv* file.

. Open the file with *remote-viewer*. A console window displays.
+
You can now use the virtual machine in the same way you would use a physical desktop.

[NOTE]
====
To allow other users to connect to the VM, make sure you restart the virtual machine when you are finished using the console. Alternatively, the administrator can *Disable strict user checking* to eliminate the need for reboot between users.
