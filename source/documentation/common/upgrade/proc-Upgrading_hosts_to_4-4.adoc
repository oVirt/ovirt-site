= Migrating hosts and virtual machines from {virt-product-shortname} 4.3 to 4.4

You can migrate hosts and virtual machines from {virt-product-fullname} 4.3 to 4.4 such that you minimize the down-time of virtual machines in your environment.

This process requires migrating all virtual machines off of one host so as to make that host available to upgrade to {virt-product-shortname} 4.4. After the upgrade, you can reattach the host to the {engine-name}.

.Prerequisites

* Hosts for {virt-product-shortname} 4.4 require {enterprise-linux} 8.2 or later. A clean installation of {enterprise-linux} 8.2 or later, or {hypervisor-fullname} 4.4 is required, even if you are using the same physical machine that you use to run hosts for {virt-product-shortname} 4.3.
* {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} 4.4 is installed and running.
* The compatibility level of the data center and cluster to which the hosts belong is set to 4.3.


.Procedure

. Pick a host to upgrade and migrate that host's virtual machines to another host in the same 4.3 cluster. You can use Live Migration to minimize virtual machine down-time.

. Install {enterprise-linux} 8.2 or later, or {hypervisor-shortname} 4.4. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}/installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_standalone_manager_with_local_databases/index#Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SM_localDB_deploy[Installing Hosts for {virt-product-fullname}] in one of the _Installing {virt-product-fullname}_ guides for more information.

. Install the appropriate packages to enable the host for {virt-product-shortname} 4.4. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}/installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_standalone_manager_with_local_databases/index#Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SM_localDB_deploy[Installing Hosts for {virt-product-fullname}] in one of the _Installing {virt-product-fullname}_ guides for more information.

. Add this host to the {engine-name}, assigning it to the same cluster. You can now migrate virtual machines onto this host. For more information, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}/installing_{URL_product_virt}_as_a_standalone_manager_with_local_databases/index#Adding_standard_hosts_to_the_Manager_SM_localDB_deploy[Adding Standard Hosts to the {engine-name}] in one of the _Installing {virt-product-fullname}_ guides for more information.

Repeat these steps to migrate virtual machines and upgrade hosts for the rest of the hosts in the same cluster, one by one, until all are running {virt-product-fullname} 4.4.
