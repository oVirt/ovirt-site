|VmCreator |Can create virtual machines in the VM Portal. |This role is not applied to a specific virtual machine; apply this role to a user for the whole environment with the *Configure* window. When applying this role to a cluster, you must also apply the *DiskCreator* role on an entire data center, or on specific storage domains.
|VnicProfileUser |Logical network and network interface user for virtual machines. |If the *Allow all users to use this Network* option was selected when a logical network is created, *VnicProfileUser* permissions are assigned to all users for the logical network.
