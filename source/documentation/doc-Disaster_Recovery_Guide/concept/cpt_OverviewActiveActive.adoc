= Active-Active Overview

The active-active disaster recovery failover configuration can span two sites. Both sites are active, and if the primary site becomes unavailable, the {virt-product-fullname} environment continues to operate in the secondary site to ensure business continuity.

The active-active failover configuration includes a stretch cluster in which hosts capable of running the virtual machines are located in both the primary and secondary sites. All the hosts belong to the same {virt-product-fullname} cluster.

This configuration requires replicated storage that is writeable on both sites so virtual machines can migrate between the two sites and continue running on both sites' storage.

Virtual machines migrate to the secondary site if the primary site becomes unavailable. The virtual machines automatically failback to the primary site when the site becomes available and the storage is replicated in both sites.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure virtual machine failover and failback works:

* Virtual machines must be configured to be highly available, and each virtual machine must have a lease on a target storage domain to ensure the virtual machine can start even without power management.
* Soft enforced virtual machine to host affinity must be configured to ensure the virtual machines only start on the selected hosts.

The stretched cluster configuration can be implemented using a self-hosted engine environment, or a standalone {engine-name} environment.
