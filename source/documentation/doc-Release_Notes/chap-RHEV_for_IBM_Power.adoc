== RHV for IBM Power

This release supports {enterprise-linux} 8 hosts on IBM POWER8 little endian hardware and {enterprise-linux} 7 and 8 virtual machines on emulated IBM POWER8 hardware. From {virt-product-fullname} 4.2.6 {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s are supported on IBM POWER9 little endian hardware and {enterprise-linux} 8 virtual machines on emulated IBM POWER9 hardware.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Previous releases of RHV for IBM Power required {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s on POWER8 hardware to be installed from an ISO image. These hosts cannot be updated for use with this release. You must reinstall {enterprise-linux} 8 hosts using the repositories outlined below.
====
The packages provided in the following repositories are required to install and configure aspects of a {virt-product-fullname} environment on POWER8 hardware.
