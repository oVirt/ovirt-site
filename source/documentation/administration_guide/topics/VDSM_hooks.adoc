=== VDSM Hooks

VDSM is extensible via hooks. Hooks are scripts executed on the host when key events occur. When a supported event occurs VDSM runs any executable hook scripts in */usr/libexec/vdsm/hooks/_nn_event-name_/* on the host in alphanumeric order. By convention each hook script is assigned a two digit number, included at the front of the file name, to ensure that the order in which the scripts will be run in is clear. You are able to create hook scripts in any programming language, Python will however be used for the examples contained in this chapter.

Note that all scripts defined on the host for the event are executed. If you require that a given hook is only executed for a subset of the virtual machines which run on the host then you must ensure that the hook script itself handles this requirement by evaluating the *Custom Properties* associated with the virtual machine.

[WARNING]
====
VDSM hooks can interfere with the operation of {virt-product-fullname}. A bug in a VDSM hook has the potential to cause virtual machine crashes and loss of data. VDSM hooks should be implemented with caution and tested rigorously. The Hooks API is new and subject to significant change in the future.
