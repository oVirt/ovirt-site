*   Last updated date: Sun January 25 2011

## Detailed Description

The feature provides administration and management functionalities for floating disks. A floating disk should behave as a flexible independent entity that can be attached to any VM.
Any virtual disk can be in a floating state - by unattaching the disk from the VM/s.

## Benefit to oVirt

The feature introduces a significant improvement to oVirt compatibility and flexabilty regarding disks usage.
Supporting a floating state for disks is essential to derived features (e.g. 'Shared RAW Disk' and 'Direct LUN Disk')
and dependent implementations (e.g. application clustering, shared data warehouse).
