## What is Gamification?

Gamification is the concept of applying game mechanics and game design techniques to [engage and motivate people to achieve their goals](http://blogs.gartner.com/brian_burke/2014/04/04/gartner-redefines-gamification/). 

It taps into the basic desires and needs of the users impulses which revolve around the idea of Status and Achievement.

To put it in other words, it is turning day-to-day tasks, the kind you might do at home or work, into a game which you can
earn points, badgets and compete with other people that are doing the same things.  

## oVirt & Gamification

You probably didn't know, but this isn't the first time oVirt gamification is being used. A few years ago there was an initiative to use oVirt UI plugins system to add Gamification to the project, there was even a "space invaders" game [written and available to play inside oVirt](https://www.ovirt.org/community/activities/gamification/)!

### So What is New?

The oVirt infra team recently reached out to 'GetBadges,' a company which provides 'Gamifcation as a Service'.
Luckly for us, open source projects gets to have a free game! So oVirt was rewarded with its own [oVirt Open Source Game](https://ovirt-ovirt-engine.getbadges.io/activity).

The game works automagically every time you contribute to the project. Current integrations are only active on specific projects like 'ovirt-engine' and 'vdsm'. If you wish to add your project to the game, please reach out to oVirt infra team and ask to add it. Current activation channels are: 

    * GitHub  - any commit merged rewards points 
    * Jenkins - any successful build rewards points and failed builds deduct points 
    * Jira    - any new ticket opened or closed in jira.ovirt.org rewards points

Other than points, you are rewarded with cool badges every time you acomplish an achievement, like triggering a first successful build. There are more cool features like slaying monsters :), you can read more detailed info on the GetBadges links below.
