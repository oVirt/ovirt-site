# Vdsm python3 compatibility

## Summary

Python 3 is already 5 years old and the pioneering distributions such as Arch Linux have been running with it as default Python interpreter for quite some time. [Soon](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Python_3_as_Default) the turn will come for Fedora, which is one of the community supported distributions of oVirt.

The goal of this page is to drive VDSM and it's components to become a single codebase that supports:

*   Python-2.6 (Could probably be eventually dropped when we make the next major version).
*   Python-2.7
*   Python-3.3+

## Instigator

*   Name: Antoni Segura Puimedon (APuimedo)
*   Email: apuimedo aT redhat.com

To help us achieve that, this page will keep links to some useful resources and a list of things ported and to port.

## Useful resources

*   [Making C Python modules 2.x and 3.x compatible with a bit of ifdefing.](http://docs.python.org/3/howto/cporting.html)
*   [Book on Python3 porting (opened at the C Python modules section).](http://python3porting.com/cextensions.html)
*   [Six: Python 2 and 3 helper library.](http://pythonhosted.org/six/)
*   [Great blog post about single codebase for the versions we want to support (MUST READ).](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/5/21/porting-to-python-3-redux/)
