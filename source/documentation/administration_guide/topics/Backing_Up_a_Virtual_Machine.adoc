[[Backing_Up_a_Virtual_Machine]]
==== Backing Up a Virtual Machine

Use the backup and restore API to back up a virtual machine. This procedure assumes you have two virtual machines: the virtual machine to back up, and a virtual machine on which the software for managing the backup is installed.


*Backing Up a Virtual Machine*

. Using the REST API, create a snapshot of the virtual machine to back up:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
POST /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/snapshots/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml

<snapshot>
    <description>BACKUP</description>
</snapshot>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* Here, replace `_{vm:id}_` with the VM ID of the virtual machine whose snapshot you are making. This ID is available from the *General* tab of the *New Virtual Machine* and *Edit Virtual Machine* windows in the *Administration Portal* and *VM Portal*.
* Taking a snapshot of a virtual machine stores its current configuration data in the `data` attribute of the `configuration` attribute in `initialization` under the snapshot.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot take snapshots of disks marked as shareable or based on direct LUN disks.
====
+
. Retrieve the configuration data of the virtual machine from the `data` attribute under the snapshot:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
GET /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/snapshots/`_{snapshot:id}_` HTTP/1.1
All-Content: true
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* Here, replace `_{vm:id}_` with the ID of the virtual machine whose snapshot you made earlier. Replace `_{snapshot:id}_` with the snapshot ID.
* Add the `All-Content: true` header to retrieve additional OVF data in the response. The OVF data in the XML response is located within the VM configuration element, `<initialization><configuration>`. Later, you will use this data to restore the virtual machine.

. Get the snapshot ID:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
GET /api/vms/{vm:id}/snapshots/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml
----
+
. Identify the disk ID of the snapshot:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
GET /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/snapshots/`_{snapshot:id}_`/disks HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml
----
+
. Attach the snapshot to a backup virtual machine as an active disk attachment, with the correct interface type (for example, *virtio_scsi*):
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
POST /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/diskattachments/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml

<disk_attachment>
	<active>true</active>
	<interface>_virtio_scsi_</interface>
	<disk id="_{disk:id}_">
	<snapshot id="_{snapshot:id}_"/>
	</disk>
</disk_attachment>
----
+
NOTE: Here, replace `_{vm:id}_` with the ID of the _backup_ virtual machine, not the virtual machine whose snapshot you made earlier. Replace `_{disk:id}_` with the disk ID. Replace `_{snapshot:id}_` with the snapshot ID.

. Use the backup software on the backup virtual machine to back up the data on the snapshot disk.
. Remove the snapshot disk attachment from the backup virtual machine:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
DELETE /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/diskattachments/`_{snapshot:id}_` HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml
----
+
NOTE: Here, replace `_{vm:id}_` with the ID of the _backup_ virtual machine, not the virtual machine whose snapshot you made earlier. Replace `_{snapshot:id}_` with the snapshot ID.

. Optionally, delete the snapshot:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
DELETE /api/vms/`_{vm:id}_`/snapshots/`_{snapshot:id}_` HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/xml
Content-type: application/xml
----
+
NOTE: Here, replace `_{vm:id}_` with the ID of the virtual machine whose snapshot you made earlier. Replace `_{snapshot:id}_` with the snapshot ID.

You have backed up the state of a virtual machine at a fixed point in time using backup software installed on a separate virtual machine.
