# Activating Storage Domains from Maintenance Mode

If you have been making changes to a data center's storage, you have to put storage domains into maintenance mode. Activate a storage domain to resume using it.

1. Click the **Storage** resource tab and select an inactive storage domain in the results list.

2. Click the **Data Centers** tab in the details pane.

3. Select the appropriate storage domain and click **Activate**.

    **Important:** If you attempt to activate the ISO domain before activating the data domain, an error message displays and the domain is not activated.
