# Refreshing Host Capabilities

When a network interface card is added to a host, the capabilities of the host must be refreshed to display that network interface card in the Manager.

**To Refresh Host Capabilities**

1. Use the resource tabs, tree mode, or the search function to find and select a host in the results list.

2. Click the **Refresh Capabilities** button.

The list of network interface cards in the **Network Interfaces** tab of the details pane for the selected host is updated. Any new network interface cards can now be used in the Manager.
