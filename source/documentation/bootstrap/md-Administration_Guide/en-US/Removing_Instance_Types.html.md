# Removing Instance Types

**Removing an Instance Type**

1. On the header bar, click **Configure**.

2. Click the **Instance Types** tab.

3. Select the instance type to be removed.

4. Click **Remove** to open the **Remove Instance Type** window.

5. If any virtual machines are based on the instance type to be removed, a warning window listing the attached virtual machines will appear. To continue removing the instance type, select the **Approve Operation** checkbox. Otherwise click **Cancel**.

6. Click **OK**.

The instance type is removed from the **Instance Types** list and can no longer be used when creating a new virtual machine. Any virtual machines that were attached to the removed instance type will now be attached to **Custom** (no instance type).
