== Self-hosted Engine Maintenance Modes

The maintenance modes enable you to start, stop, and modify the {engine-name} virtual machine without interference from the high-availability agents, and to restart and modify the self-hosted engine nodes in the environment without interfering with the {engine-name}.

There are three maintenance modes that can be enforced:

* `global` - All high-availability agents in the cluster are disabled from monitoring the state of the {engine-name} virtual machine. The global maintenance mode must be applied for any setup or upgrade operations that require the `ovirt-engine` service to be stopped, such as upgrading to a later version of {virt-product-fullname}.

* `local` - The high-availability agent on the node issuing the command is disabled from monitoring the state of the {engine-name} virtual machine. The node is exempt from hosting the {engine-name} virtual machine while in local maintenance mode; if hosting the {engine-name} virtual machine when placed into this mode, the {engine-name} will migrate to another node, provided there is one available. The local maintenance mode is recommended when applying system changes or updates to a self-hosted engine node.

* `none` - Disables maintenance mode, ensuring that the high-availability agents are operating.

== Setting Local Maintenance

Stop the high-availability agent on a single self-hosted engine node.

.Setting the local maintenance mode from the Administration Portal

. Put a self-hosted engine node into local maintenance mode:
.. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts] and select a self-hosted engine node.
.. Click menu:Management[Maintenance]. Local maintenance mode is automatically triggered for that node.

. After you have completed any maintenance tasks, disable the maintenance mode:
.. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts] and select the self-hosted engine node.
.. Click menu:Management[Activate].

.Setting the local maintenance mode from the command line

.  Log in to a self-hosted engine node and put it into local maintenance mode:
+
----
# hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=local
----

. After you have completed any maintenance tasks, disable the maintenance mode:
+
----
# hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=none
----

== Setting Global Maintenance

Stop the high-availability agents on all self-hosted engine nodes in the cluster.

.Setting the global maintenance mode from the Administration Portal

. Put all of the self-hosted engine nodes into global maintenance mode:
.. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts] and select any self-hosted engine node.
.. Click *More Actions* (image:../common/images/moreactions.png[]), then click *Enable Global HA Maintenance*.
. After you have completed any maintenance tasks, disable the maintenance mode:
.. In the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts] and select any self-hosted engine node.
.. Click *More Actions* (image:../common/images/moreactions.png[]), then click *Disable Global HA Maintenance*.

.Setting the global maintenance mode from the command line

.  Log in to any self-hosted engine node and put it into global maintenance mode:
+
----
# hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=global
----

. After you have completed any maintenance tasks, disable the maintenance mode:
+
----
# hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=none
----
