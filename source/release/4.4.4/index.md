# oVirt 4.4.4 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.4 release as of December 21, 2020.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2/8.3 (8.3 recommended) and
CentOS Linux 8.2 (or similar).

To find out how to interact with oVirt developers and users and ask questions,
visit our [community page](/community/).
All issues or bugs should be reported via
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).


If you'd like to try oVirt as quickly as possible, follow the instructions on
the [Download](/download/) page.

For complete installation, administration, and usage instructions, see
the [oVirt Documentation](/documentation/).

For a general overview of oVirt, read the [About oVirt](/community/about.html)
page.

To learn about features introduced before 4.4.4, see the
[release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).

## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.4 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.4 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.4).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.4?

### Release Note

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1899865](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1899865) **[RFE] Remove dpdk from host networking**

   Experimental support for DPDK has been removed in oVirt 4.4.4


### Enhancements

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1859092](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1859092) **Logical Name is missing when attaching RO direct LUN to a VM**

   Previously, the logical name of LUN disks within the guest weren't pull to the user visibility. Now, the LUN logical name is pulled and shown in the disk device.


#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1866363](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1866363) **[RFE] Add variables to choose specific entity**

   Feature: 

Add '$host_id' and '$vm_id' variables to choose specific entity.



Reason: 

In order to allow selection and search of virtual machines or hosts.



Result:

It will be possible to view the relevant reports according to a selected virtual machine or host. In addition it will be possible to search for the machine or host in the variable's search bar.

 - [BZ 1851725](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1851725) **[RFE] Add tags to grafana dashboards**

   Feature: 

Add tags to grafana dashboards.

The tags are:

1. Cluster

2. DC (Data Center)

3. Host

4. VM

5. SD (Storage Domains)

6. CPU

7. Memory

8. Disk

9. Interface 

10. Downtime

11. Uptime

12. OS (Operating System) 

13. HA (High Availability)



Reason: 

Adding tags will make it easier to sort and know the contents of dashboards.



Result:

Each dashboard will have a number of tags that describe the content displayed within it.


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1884233](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1884233) **oVirt-engine reports misleading login-domain for external RH-SSO accounts**
   The authz name is now used as the user domain on the oVirt Engine home page. It replaces the profile name.
   Additionally, several log statements related to authorization/authentication flow have been made consistent by presenting both the user authz name and the profile name where applicable.
   In this release, `<username>@<authz name>` is displayed on the home page once the user is successfully logged in to the ovirt-engine.
   In addition, the log statements now contain both the authz name and the profile name as well as the username.

 - [BZ 1729897](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1729897) **[RFE] Per-vNUMA node tuning modes**

   Previously, the NUMA tune mode was set to the VM, setting every virtual NUMA node of the VM with this setting. Now, it is possible to set NUMA tune mode for each virtual NUMA node.

 - [BZ 1576923](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1576923) **RFE: Ability to move master role to another domain without putting the domain to maintenance**

   Feature:

Add the ability to move the master role to another domain without putting the domain to maintenance, using the REST API. 



Reason:

Currently, you can't migrate the master role to a newer domain, without migrating the VMs from the old one and putting it on maintenance.



Another scenario was the inability to put on maintenance a hosted_storage domain. 



Result: 

There's now an option to move the master role using the REST API to a different storage domain, without putting them into maintenance.

For example, for setting a storage domain with ID '456' as a master on a data center with ID '123', send a request like this:



POST /ovirt-engine/api/datacenters/123/setmaster



With a request body like this:


```xml
<action>

  <storage_domain id="456"/>

</action>
```


There's also an option for using the storage domain's name:

```xml
<action>

  <storage_domain>

    <name>my-nfs</name>

  </storage_domain>

</action>
```


The specified storage domain should become the new master storage domain.

 - [BZ 1859092](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1859092) **Logical Name is missing when attaching RO direct LUN to a VM**

   Previously, the logical name of LUN disks within the guest weren't pull to the user visibility. Now, the LUN logical name is pulled and shown in the disk device.

 - [BZ 1872210](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1872210) **[RFE] Don't require ovirt-guest-agent on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver) and newer**

   Feature: Added support for Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9 and later versions. Also turned off ovirt guest agent for Ubuntu 18.04 and later as well as Debian 9 versions and later.



Reason: To support the latest Ubuntu Operating Systems and to turn off ovirt guest agent support for the latest Ubuntu and Debian versions.



Result: The latest Ubuntu and Debian Operating Systems are now supported without ovirt guest agent support.


#### oVirt Ansible collection

 - [BZ 1893385](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1893385) **hosted-engine deploy (restore-from-file) fails if any non-management logical network is marked as required in backup file**

   In previous versions, when using 'hosted-engine --restore-from-file' to restore or upgrade, if the backup included extra required networks in the cluster, and if the user did not reply 'Yes' to the question about pausing the execution, deployment failed.



With this version, regardless of the answer to 'pause?', if the host is found to be in state "Non Operational", deployment will pause, outputting relevant information to the user, and waiting until a lock file is removed. This should allow the user to then connect to the web admin UI and manually handle the situation, activate the host, and then remove the lock file and continue the deployment.



This version also allows supplying a custom hook to fix such and similar issues automatically.



Doc team: Perhaps instead of above, or in addition to it, open a doc bug. See also comment 27 for details.
