# Backend modules beans

**Introduction:** The beans module is a job scheduler, and is essentially a wrapper around [Quartz](http://quartz-scheduler.org/), which might be described as a beefier, platform-agnostic Cron jobs alternative that can be embedded in a Java project.

The beans module is used extensively when monitoring hosts. The [VDSBroker](Backend modules vdsbroker) module's class VdsUpdateRunTimeInfo monitors hosts' CPU, memory usage and so on. A method of the IRSBrokerCommand class monitors the SPM-host for storage related issues.
