      # oVirt Deployment Options

      oVirt is a virtual datacenter manager that delivers powerful management of multiple virtual machines on multiple hosts. Using KVM and libvirt, oVirt can be installed on Fedora, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts to set up and manage your virtual data center.

      If you are absolutely new to oVirt, try our [Live version](OVirt_Live) where you can test-drive oVirt on CentOS without installing it on your machine.

      If you have some knowledge of installing packages on Linux, you can install [oVirt](#Install_oVirt) directly on a host machine.

      Experienced users can also compile from source, using the guides for the [oVirt Engine](OVirt_Engine_Development_Environment) and [oVirt Node](Node_Building).

  ## GPG Keys used by oVirt

  **Important:** We are going to sign RPMs only from next release. Please wait for the announcement email

  How does oVirt Project use GPG keys to sign packages? Each stable RPM package that is published by oVirt Project is signed with a GPG signature. By default, yum and the graphical update tools will verify these signatures and refuse to install any packages that are not signed or have bad signatures. You should always verify the signature of a package before you install it. These signatures ensure that the packages you install are what was produced by the oVirt Project and have not been altered (accidentally or maliciously) by any mirror or website that is providing the packages. Nightly repositories wont be signed.

  ### Importing Keys Manually

  For some repositories, such as repositories with stable in default configuration, yum is able to find a proper key for the repository and asks the user for confirmation before importing the key if the key is not already imported into the rpm database.

  To get the public key:

      $ gpg --recv-keys FE590CB7
      $ gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint FE590CB7
      ---
      pub   2048R/FE590CB7 2014-03-30 [expires: 2021-04-03]
            Key fingerprint = 31A5 D783 7FAD 7CB2 86CD  3469 AB8C 4F9D FE59 0CB7
      uid                  oVirt <infra@ovirt.org>
      sub   2048R/004BC303 2014-03-30 [expires: 2021-04-03]
      ---
      $ gpg --export --armor FE590CB7 > ovirt-infra.pub
      # rpm --import ovirt-infra.pub

  Importing keys Automatically

      yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm

  **Important:** yum will prompt sysadmin to acknowledge import of key, make sure key id is FE590CB7.

  ### Verifying a package

  When using default configuration of yum package updating and installation tool in stable releases, signature of each package is verified before it is installed. Signature verification can be turned off and on globally or for specific repository with gpgcheck directive. Do not override the default setting of this directive unless you have a very good reason to do so. If you do not use yum, you can check the signature of the package using the following command

      rpm {-K|--checksig} PACKAGE_FILE ...

  ### Currently used keys

  | Key ID | Key Type | Key Fingerprint | Key Description | Created | Expires | Revoked | Notes |
  |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
  | `FE590CB7` | 2048-bit RSA | `31A5 D783 7FAD 7CB2 86CD 3469 AB8C 4F9D FE59 0CB7` | oVirt | 2014-03-30 | 2021-04-03 |

  ## Install oVirt

  oVirt release 3.6 is intended for production use and is available for the following platforms:

  - [Fedora](#Fedora_Installation_Instructions)
  - [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_62FCentOS_Installation_Instructions)
  - [CentOS](#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_62FCentOS_Installation_Instructions)
  - Scientific Linux
  - [Gentoo](//wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OVirt) (Experimental)
  - [Debian / Ubuntu](Ovirt_build_on_debian/ubuntu)

  Our recommended method of installing oVirt is to use the pre-built packages for Fedora or a supported Enterprise Linux 7 distribution,
  such as CentOS Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This makes installing oVirt very easy.
  Naturally, you can run most Linux distributions or several other operating systems (e.g. Windows)
  as [guests](#Supported_Guest_Distributions) inside of oVirt instances.

  {:.alert.alert-warning}
  **Important:** If you're upgrading from a previous version, please update ovirt-release36 and verify
  you have the correct repositories enabled by running the following commands before upgrading with the usual procedure.
  ```
  # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm
  ```

  .col-md-6
    :markdown
      ### Fedora {#Fedora_Installation_Instructions}
      1.  Add the official oVirt repository for Fedora.

              sudo yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm

          -   This will add repositories from ovirt.org to your host allowing you to get the latest and greatest oVirt rpms.
          -   It will also enable any other needed repository including for example [virt-preview](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Virtualization_Preview_Repository) repository on your machine giving you access to the latest versions of things like libvirt and KVM.

      2.  Install oVirt Engine.

              sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine

      3.  Set up oVirt Engine.

              sudo engine-setup

      4.  Follow the on screen prompts to configure and install the engine
      5.  Once you have successfully installed oVirt Engine, you will be provided with instructions to access oVirt's web-based management interface.
      6.  Congratulations! oVirt Engine is now installed!
      7.  For every virtualization server you'd like to manage, you can now [set them up as oVirt hosts](Quick_Start_Guide#Install_Hosts) .


  .col-md-6
    :markdown
      ### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6/CentOS {#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_62FCentOS_Installation_Instructions}

      These instructions should work for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS. They will likely work with other binary compatible EL6 versions as well, but they were not tested. It is strongly recommended that you use at least version 6.5 of RHEL or CentOS.

      **Warning:** Native GlusterFS support will not work with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 at this time.

      1.  Add the official oVirt repository for EL6.

              sudo yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm

          -   This will add repositories from ovirt.org to your host allowing you to get the latest and greatest oVirt rpms.
          -   It will also enable the gluster and EPEL repositories for their latest release, so you will get those updates correctly as well

      2.  Install oVirt Engine.

              sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine

      3.  Set up oVirt Engine.

              sudo engine-setup

      4.  Follow the on screen prompts to configure and install the engine
      5.  Once you have successfully installed oVirt Engine, you will be provided with instructions to access oVirt's web-based management interface.
      6.  Congratulations! oVirt Engine is now installed!
      7.  For every virtualization server you'd like to manage, you can now [set them up as oVirt nodes](/Quick_Start_Guide#Install_Hosts) .
