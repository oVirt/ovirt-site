=== Read Only Disks in {virt-product-fullname}

Some applications require administrators to share data with read-only rights. You can do this when creating or editing a disk attached to a virtual machine via the *Disks* tab in the details view of the virtual machine and selecting the *Read Only* check box. That way, a single disk can be read by multiple cluster-aware guests, while an administrator maintains writing privileges.

You cannot change the read-only status of a disk while the virtual machine is running.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Mounting a journaled file system requires read-write access. Using the *Read Only* option is not appropriate for virtual disks that contain such file systems (e.g. *EXT3*, *EXT4*, or *XFS*).
