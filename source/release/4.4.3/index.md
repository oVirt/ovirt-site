# oVirt 4.4.3 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.3 release as of November 10, 2020.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2/8.3 (8.3 recommended) and
CentOS Linux 8.2 (or similar).

To find out how to interact with oVirt developers and users and ask questions,
visit our [community page](/community/).
All issues or bugs should be reported via
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).


If you'd like to try oVirt as quickly as possible, follow the instructions on
the [Download](/download/) page.

For complete installation, administration, and usage instructions, see
the [oVirt Documentation](/documentation/).

For a general overview of oVirt, read the [About oVirt](/community/about.html)
page.

To learn about features introduced before 4.4.3, see the
[release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).

## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**, 

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.3 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.3 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.3).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.3?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1888626](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1888626) **Require ansible-2.9.14 in ovirt-engine**

   Ansible-2.9.14 is required for proper setup and functioning of Red Hat Virtualization Manager 4.4.3.

 - [BZ 1824103](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1824103) **Lifespan of certificates created by oVirt engine CA should not exceed 398 days**

   Up until 4.4.3 RHV used below validity lifetime for certificates:



1. CA certificate - 10 years

2. RHV Manager HTTPS certificate - 5 years

3. RHV hypervisors certificates 5 - years



But due recent efforts to reduce certificate lifetime [1][2] we have decided to shorten RHV certificate lifetime to align with those suggestions:



1. CA certificate - 10 years (no change)

2. RHV Manager HTTPS certificate - 398 days

3. RHV hypervisors certificates 398 days



This change doesn't affect existing certificates, it will be applied only on newly created certificates in RHV 4.4.3 and newer.



We have also discussed to shorten RHV CA certificate lifetime, but we have decided not to change the lifetime, because expiring CA certificate requires reenrolling certificates for all hosts, which means that all hosts needs to go to Maintenance status and this is very disruptive operation.

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1177156](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1177156) **[RFE] Ability to clone a running VM directly from GUI**

   

 - [BZ 1752751](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1752751) **[RFE] Show vCPUs and allocated memory in virtual machines summary**

   Features delivered under this issue (by their importance): 



1. Chosen grid settings (column visibility and order) are now by default persisted on the server. Existing settings will be migrated (uploaded) to the server. Functionality can be disabled by de-selecting checkbox 'Persist grid settings' in the Options pop-up (see screenshot).



2. It's now possible to reset grid settings - this option is now available via newly added action button (kebab button) in the top right corner of the grid (check animated gif for details)



3. Two new columns were added to Virtual Machine screen: number  of vCPUs and Memory in MB (see the screenshot for exact labels). Columns are hidden by default. User may show them by using column context menu (existing feature: pop-up triggered by right click on any column header) or by action "Change column visibility/order" (via kebab button added as part of this story - see screenshots).

 - [BZ 1862968](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1862968) **[RFE] auto-set cpu and numa to a vm for best performance**

   This feature will introduce a way to automatically set the CPU and NUMA pinning of a VM.

Currently, it is optional to do so when adding a VM using REST-API only.

The new value is: auto_pinning_policy. It can be set to `existing`, using the current topology of the VM's CPU. Or, it can be set to `adjust`, using the dedicated host CPU topology, changing it accordingly to the VM.

The result will provide a better performance to that VM.

 - [BZ 1568461](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1568461) **[RFE] Kernel address space layout randomization [KASLR] support**

   

 - [BZ 1881119](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1881119) **[RFE] Make engine-backup refuse to restore a backup from a version earlier than 4.3.10**

   engine-backup now refuses to restore a backup taken with a version earlier than 4.3.10, to prevent a missing cinderlib database on restore - as cinderlib database backup was added on in 4.3.10.

 - [BZ 1797717](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1797717) **Search backend cannot find VMs which name starts with a search keyword**

   Feature: 



Enable to use a keyword in a free text search in search engine.



Search engine enables to enter free text pattern in a search expression, this

kind of search looks for the pattern on all the entity fields.



In the case that the free text pattern starts with a keyword (column

name) that is related to the searched entity, search engine fails to

find the expected results and generates an error.



For example, if you have a cluster named "namedCluster" and you are

searching for "Cluster:name*" , you will get an empty result and an

error complaining on illegal search, also if you are doing that from UI ,

you will see that the character '*' is marked with red.



Reason: 



search engine should enable to search for entity column values that are prefixed with a keyword



Result: 



Support for search for entity column values that are prefixed with a keyword was added

 - [BZ 1657294](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1657294) **[RFE] - enable renaming HostedEngine VM name**

   Feature: 

Let the user specify a custom name for the engine VM

 - [BZ 1828347](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1828347) **[RFE] support virtio-win flows in 4.4**

   Previously, you used Windows Guest Tools to install the required drivers for virtual machines running Microsoft Windows. Now, RHV version 4.4 uses VirtIO-Win to provide these drivers. For clusters with a compatibility level of 4.4 and later, the engine sign of the guest-agent depends on the available VirtIO-Win. The auto-attaching of a driver ISO is dropped in favor of Microsoft Windows updates. However, the initial installation needs to be done manually.

 - [BZ 1854888](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1854888) **RHV-M shows successful operation if OVA export/import failed during "qemu-img convert" phase**

   Feature: Added error handling for ova importing and exporting.



Reason: When the qemu-img process failed, the engine was reporting a successful completion of the process when the process actually failed.



Result: Now when the qemu-img process fails to compete, the failure is detected and reported to the engine which fails appropriately.


#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1851029](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1851029) **[RFE] Add to time based queries the samples table**

   Previously, time-based Grafana reports did not include the most recent two to three hours of sample data. With this update, you can now view sample data from that time period.



For example, if you ran the report at 11:54, the report had data only until 9:00. Now the report has data until 11:54.

### Other

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1891520](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1891520) **Moving or copying raw preallocated disk to file storage make the disk sparse**

   

 - [BZ 1861674](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1861674) **[CBT] Report backup mode (full or incremental) for disks that participates in the VM backup**

   A new field added to a disk, this field called 'backup_mode'.



The backup_mode is used only if the disk is part of a backup operation, otherwise, the backup_mode will be 'NULL'.



If the disk is part of a running backup, the backup_mode can have one of the two options - 



 - full - if the backup that was taken for the disk was a 

   full backup.



 - incremental - if the backup that was taken for the disk 

   was an incremental backup.



This will allow the engine to create a backup for a VM that contains both full for the disks that were not part of the previous backup and incremental backup for the disks that already backed up in the previous backup.



The user can check the disk's backup_mode and download the backup using the right method in imageio according to it.
