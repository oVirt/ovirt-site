# oVirt 4.2.4 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.4 Release as of June 26, 2018.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5,
CentOS Linux 7.5 (or similar).


For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.4, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### No Fedora support

Regretfully, Fedora is not supported anymore, and RPMs for it are not provided.
These are still built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
At this point, we only try to fix problems specific to Fedora if they affect
developers. For some of the work to be done to restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1549030](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1549030) <b>Update neutron binding after VM migration with info from caps</b><br>When a port is created/updated, it's "binding:host_id" attribute should be updated with the id of the provider driver id (for example OVN chassis id) reported during get_caps. <br>The port for which the binding has been reported, requires the binding to be set on every consecutive host it moves to. This could be a problem when migrating from a 4.2.2 level host to an earlier one. <br>Hosts before that do not report the host_id. When no provider driver id is reported, the "binding:host_id" is not set, and the value from the previous host will be kept. To fix this, the older hosts need to be updated with a newer version of the provider driver.
 - [BZ 1539765](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1539765) <b>Auto-Sync - network rename on provider does not trigger rename in engine</b><br>Feature:  External network rename on provider is reflected in engine<br><br>Reason: The name of an external network in engine should be consistent with the name of the same network on the provider.<br><br>Result: Renaming an external network on the provider is reflected in engine.
 - [BZ 1098612](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1098612) <b>[donstream clone 4.2.4] [RFE] filter for "Allocation Policy" in Disks search</b><br>
 - [BZ 1242822](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1242822) <b>[RFE] filter for "Allocation Policy" in Disks search</b><br>
 - [BZ 1251468](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1251468) <b>[RFE] Additional warning when removing required networks</b><br>
 - [BZ 1593653](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1593653) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.4] [RFE] virtio nics are reported as '1gbit' nics, and should be '10gbit'</b><br>
 - [BZ 1587884](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1587884) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.4] [RFE] Include storage domain UUID in Storage Domain 'General' tab</b><br>
 - [BZ 1579302](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1579302) <b>support more granularity in cluster cpu types</b><br>Feature: <br>Support distinguishing cpus also by features they support, not just by model.<br><br>Reason: <br>If a new CPU feature is important, it is important to be able to distinguish if the CPU with some model also supports this feature and than require this feature also for VMs.<br><br>Result: <br>Now, it is possible to distinguish CPUs also by features and require them for the VMs. CPU types take additional flags in addition to their libvirt name. Like e.g. SandyBridge, you can specify custom CPU as “SandyBridge,+xyz” or “SandyBridge,-xyz” to add or remove arbitrary individual CPU flags in addition to what the named model contains.
 - [BZ 1577901](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1577901) <b>[RFE] add content type column to disk table</b><br>

#### oVirt Engine Appliance

 - [BZ 1582507](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1582507) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.4] [RFE] Add  ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap-setup and  ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap to RHV-M Image</b><br>

#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1579210](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1579210) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.4] add cockpit-machines-ovirt to RHVH hosts</b><br>The cockpit-machines-ovirt plugin (https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/feature-ovirtvirtualmachines) has been added to Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts and Red Hat Virtualization Hosts.
