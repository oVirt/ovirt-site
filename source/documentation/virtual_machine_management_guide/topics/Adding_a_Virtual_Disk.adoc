[[Adding_a_Virtual_Disk]]
==== Adding a New Virtual Disk

You can add multiple virtual disks to a virtual machine.

*Image* is the default type of disk. You can also add a *Direct LUN* disk. *Image* disk creation is managed entirely by the {engine-name}. *Direct LUN* disks require externally prepared targets that already exist. Existing disks are either floating disks or shareable disks attached to virtual machines.


*Adding Disks to Virtual Machines*

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines].
. Click a virtual machine name to go to the details view.
. Click the *Disks* tab.
. Click btn:[New].
. Use the appropriate radio buttons to switch between *Image* and *Direct LUN*.
. Enter a *Size(GB)*, *Alias*, and *Description* for the new disk.
. Use the drop-down lists and check boxes to configure the disk. See xref:Add_Virtual_Disk_dialogue_entries[] for more details on the fields for all disk types.
. Click btn:[OK].


The new disk appears in the details view after a short time.
