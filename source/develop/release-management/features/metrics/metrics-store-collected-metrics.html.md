# Metrics Store - Collected Data

## Statistics Collection
collectd gathers oVirt statistics from the oVirt engine and hypervisors, and transfers the data to fluentd.

The data is then transformed, enriched, and sent to the remote metrics store.

## Logs Collection
fluentd collects oVirt logs from the oVirt engine and hypervisors.
The data is then transformed, enriched and sent to the remote metrics store.

Logs collected from the engine machine include:

* engine.log

Logs collected from the hypervisors machines include:

* vdsm.log
