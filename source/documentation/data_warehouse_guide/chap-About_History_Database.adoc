== Statistics History Views

Statistics data is available in `hourly`, `daily`, and `samples` views.

To query a statistics view, run `SELECT * FROM _view_name__[hourly|daily|samples];`. For example:
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# SELECT * FROM v4_4_statistics_hosts_resources_usage_daily;
----

To list all available views, run:
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# \dv

== Configuration History Views

To query a configuration view, run `SELECT * FROM _view_name_;`. For example:
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]

----

To list all available views, run:
[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
# \dv

[NOTE]
====
`delete_date` does not appear in latest views because these views provide the latest configuration of living entities, which, by definition, have not been deleted.
