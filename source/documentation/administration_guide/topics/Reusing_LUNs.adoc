[[Reusing_LUNs]]
==== Reusing LUNs

LUNs cannot be reused, as is, to create a storage domain or virtual disk. If you try to reuse the LUNs, the Administration Portal displays the following error message:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Physical device initialization failed. Please check that the device is empty and accessible by the host.
----

A self-hosted engine shows the following error during installation:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
[ ERROR ] Error creating Volume Group: Failed to initialize physical device: ("[u'/dev/mapper/000000000000000000000000000000000']",)
[ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Misc configuration': Failed to initialize physical device: ("[u'/dev/mapper/000000000000000000000000000000000']",)
----

Before the LUN can be reused, the old partitioning table must be cleared.
