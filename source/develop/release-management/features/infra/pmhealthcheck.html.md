### Current status

*   Last updated date: MAY 4, 2014

### Detailed Description

The requirement is to add a periodic health check of all Hosts with configured PM
The scheduled job will try to send a status command to all PM enabled hosts periodically (once a hour by default) and raise alerts for failed operations

### Benefit to oVirt

This feature will improve Host availability since once a Host fails the PM status command, the administrator will see the raised alert and will be able to address the problem ASAP
