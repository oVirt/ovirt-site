= Self-Hosted Engine Architecture

The {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} runs as a virtual machine on self-hosted engine nodes (specialized hosts) in the same environment it manages. A self-hosted engine environment requires one less physical server, but requires more administrative overhead to deploy and manage. The {engine-name} is highly available without external HA management.

The minimum setup of a self-hosted engine environment includes:

* One {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} virtual machine that is hosted on the self-hosted engine nodes. The {engine-appliance-name} is used to automate the installation of a {enterprise-linux} 7 virtual machine, and the {engine-name} on that virtual machine. 

* A minimum of two self-hosted engine nodes for virtual machine high availability. You can use {enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s or {hypervisor-fullname}s ({hypervisor-shortname}). VDSM (the host agent) runs on all hosts to facilitate communication with the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. The HA services run on all self-hosted engine nodes to manage the high availability of the {engine-name} virtual machine.

* One storage service, which can be hosted locally or on a remote server, depending on the storage type used. The storage service must be accessible to all hosts.
