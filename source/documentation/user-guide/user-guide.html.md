2.  Click **Add Exception** to open the **Add Security Exception** window.
3.  Ensure the **Permanently store this exception** check box is selected.
4.  Click the **Confirm Security Exception** button.

**Result**

You have installed the certificate used by the Red hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager and security warnings no longer appear when you access the User Portal.

## ⁠Installing Supporting Components

### Installing Console Components

#### Console Components

A console is a graphical window that allows you to view the start up screen, shut down screen and desktop of a virtual machine, and to interact with that virtual machine in a similar way to a physical machine. In oVirt, the default application for opening a console to a virtual machine is Remote Viewer, which must be installed on the client machine prior to use.

#### Installing Remote Viewer on Linux

Remote Viewer is an application for opening a graphical console to virtual machines. Remote Viewer is a SPICE client that is included the virt-viewer package provided by the `Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation (v. 6 for x86_64)` channel.

**Procedure 2.1. Installing Remote Viewer on Linux**

1.  Run the following command to install the spice-xpi package and dependencies:
        # yum install spice-xpi

2.  Run the following command to check whether the **virt-viewer** package has already been installed on your system:
        # rpm -q virt-viewer
        virt-viewer-0.5.2-18.el6_4.2.x86_64

    If the virt-viewer package has not been installed, run the following command to install the package and its dependencies:

        # yum install virt-viewer

3.  Restart Firefox for your changes to take effect.

The SPICE plug-in is now installed. You can now connect to your virtual machines using the SPICE protocol.

## ⁠The Basic Tab

### Basic Tab Graphical Interface

The **Basic** tab enables you to view and use all the virtual machines that are available to you. The screen consists of three areas: the title bar, a virtual machines area, and a details pane. A number of control buttons allow you to work with the virtual machines.

![The User Portal](User Portal Callouts.png "The User Portal")

**Figure 3.1. The User Portal**

The title bar (1) includes the name of the **User** logged in to the portal and the **Sign Out** button.

In the virtual machines area, the name of the virtual machines or virtual machine pools assigned to you display (2). The logo of the virtual machine's operating system also displays (3). When a virtual machine is powered up, you can connect to it by double-clicking on the virtual machine's logo.

On each virtual machine's icon, buttons allow you to play, stop or pause a virtual machine. The buttons perform the same functions as buttons on a media player (4).

*   ![](Up.png "fig:Up.png") The green play button starts up the virtual machine. It is available when the virtual machine is paused, stopped or powered off.
*   ![](Down.png "fig:Down.png") The red stop button stops the virtual machine. It is available when the virtual machine is running.
*   ![](Suspend.png "fig:Suspend.png") The blue pause button temporarily halts the virtual machine. To restart it, press the green play button.
*   ![](Reboot.png "fig:Reboot.png") The green reboot button reboots the virtual machine. It is available when the virtual machine is running.

The status of the virtual machine is indicated by the text below the virtual machine's icon - **Machine is Ready** or **Machine is Down**.

Clicking on a virtual machine displays the statistics of the selected virtual machine on the details pane to the right (5), including the operating system, defined memory, number of cores and size of virtual drives. You can also configure connection protocol options (6) such as enabling the use of USB devices or local drives.

### Running Virtual Machines

#### Running Virtual Machines - Overview

In the User Portal, virtual machines are represented by icons that indicate both type and status. The icons indicate whether a virtual machine is part of a virtual machine pool or is a standalone Windows or Linux virtual machine. The icons also reflect whether the virtual machine is running or stopped.

The User Portal displays a list of the virtual machines assigned to you. You can turn on one or more virtual machines, connect, and log in. You can access virtual machines that are running different operating systems, and you can use multiple virtual machines simultaneously.

In contrast, if you have only one running virtual machine and have enabled automatic connection, you can bypass the User Portal and log in directly to the virtual machine, similar to how you log in to a physical machine.

#### Turning on a Virtual Machine

To use a virtual machine in the User Portal, you must turn it on and then connect to it. If a virtual machine is turned off, it is grayed out and displays **Machine is Down**.

You can be assigned an individual virtual machine or assigned to one or more virtual machines that are part of a virtual machine pool. Virtual machines in a pool are all clones of a base template, and have the same operating system and installed applications.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** When you take a virtual machine from a virtual machine pool, you are not guaranteed to receive the same VM each time. However, if you configure console options for a VM taken from a virtual machine pool, those options are saved as the default for all VMs taken from that virtual machine pool.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 3.1. Turning on a Virtual Machine**

1.  Turn on the standalone virtual machine or take a virtual machine from a pool as follows:
    -   To turn on a standalone virtual machine, select the virtual machine icon and click the ![](Up.png "fig:Up.png") button.
        ⁠

        ![Turn on virtual machine](VM Powered Down.png "Turn on virtual machine")

        **Figure 3.2. Turn on virtual machine**

    -   To take a virtual machine from a pool, select the virtual machine pool icon and click the ![](Up.png "fig:Up.png") button.
        ⁠

        ![Take virtual machine from a pool](VM From Pool.png "Take virtual machine from a pool")

        **Figure 3.3. Take virtual machine from a pool**

        If there is an available virtual machine in the pool, an icon for that virtual machine will appear in your list. The rest of this procedure then applies to that virtual machine. If you can take multiple virtual machines from a pool, the icon for the virtual machine pool will change into an icon for the last virtual machine you have taken when you take the maximum number of virtual machines possible for that pool.

2.  The virtual machine powers up.
    ⁠

    ![Virtual machine powering up](VM Powering Up.png "Virtual machine powering up")

    **Figure 3.4. Virtual machine powering up**

3.  When the virtual machine is powered up, the icon is no longer grayed out. The text displays as **Machine is Ready**. You are now ready to connect.
    ⁠

    ![Virtual machine turned on](VM Powered Up.png "Virtual machine turned on")

    **Figure 3.5. Virtual machine turned on**

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can only connect to a virtual machine after it has powered up.

</div>
#### Connecting to a Powered-On Virtual Machine

After a virtual machine has been turned on, you can connect to it, log in, and start work the same way that you would with a physical machine. The text "Machine is Ready" displays on virtual machines that are powered up.

**Procedure 3.2. Connecting to a Powered on Virtual Machine**

1.  Double-click on the selected virtual machine to connect.
    ⁠

    ![Connect to Virtual Machine](Connect to a VM.png "Connect to Virtual Machine")

    **Figure 3.6. Connect to Virtual Machine**

2.  A console window of the virtual machine displays. You can now use the virtual machine in the same way that you would use a physical desktop.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** The first time you connect with SPICE, you are prompted to install the appropriate SPICE component or plug-in. If it is the first time you are connecting from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux computer, install the SPICE plug-in for Mozilla Firefox. If you are connecting from a Windows computer, install the ActiveX plug-in.

</div>
#### Logging Out of a Virtual Machine

It is recommended that you log out from a virtual machine before shutting it down, to minimize the risk of data loss. Additionally, if you attempt to forcefully shut down a virtual machine from the User Portal, it might freeze with a status of **Powering Down**. To gracefully turn off a virtual machine, use the following steps.

**Procedure 3.3. Shutting Down a Virtual Machine**

1.  Log out of the guest operating system.
2.  If you were using your virtual machine in full screen mode, press **Shift**+**F11** to exit full screen mode, and close the virtual machine's console window. You are now returned to the User Portal.
3.  To shut down the virtual machine, click the ![](Down.png "fig:Down.png") button. The virtual machine is grayed out and displays as "Machine is Down" when it has been turned off.

## ⁠Chapter 4. The Extended Tab

#### Creating a Virtual Machine Based on a Template

**Summary**

You can create virtual machines based on templates. This allows you to create virtual machines that are pre-configured with an operating system, network interfaces, applications and other resources.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Virtual machines created based on a template depend on that template. This means that you cannot remove that template from the Manager if there is a virtual machine that was created based on that template. However, you can clone a virtual machine from a template to remove the dependency on that template.

</div>
**Procedure 4.5. Creating a Virtual Machine Based on a Template**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab.
2.  Click the **New VM** button to open the **New Virtual Machine** window.

    -   Selecting **Preallocated** results in a slower clone operation and provides optimized virtual machine read and write operations. All disk space requested in the template is allocated at the time of the clone operation.

10. Use the **Target** drop-down menu to select the storage domain on which the virtual machine's virtual disk will be stored.
11. Click **OK**.

**Result**

The virtual machine is created and displayed in the list in the **Virtual Machines** tab. You can now log on to the virtual machine and begin using it, or assign users to it.

#### Creating a Cloned Virtual Machine Based on a Template

**Summary**

Cloned virtual machines are similar to virtual machines based on templates. However, while a cloned virtual machine inherits settings in the same way as a virtual machine based on a template, a cloned virtual machine does not depend on the template on which it was based after it has been created.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** If you clone a virtual machine from a template, the name of the template on which that virtual machine was based is displayed in the **General** tab of the **Edit Virtual Machine** window for that virtual machine. If you change the name of that template, the name of the template in the **General** tab will also be updated. However, if you delete the template from the Manager, the original name of that template will be displayed instead.

</div>
### Templates

#### Introduction to Templates

A template is a copy of a preconfigured virtual machine, used to simplify the subsequent, repeated creation of similar virtual machines. Templates capture installed software and software configurations, as well as the hardware configuration, of the original virtual machine.

When you create a template from a virtual machine, a read-only copy of the virtual machine's disk is taken. The read-only disk becomes the base disk image of the new template, and of any virtual machines created from the template. As such, the template cannot be deleted whilst virtual machines created from the template exist in the environment.

Virtual machines created from a template use the same NIC type and driver as the original virtual machine, but utilize separate and unique MAC addresses.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** A virtual machine may require to be sealed before being used to create a template.

</div>
#### Template Tasks

##### Creating a Template

**Summary**

Create a template from an existing virtual machine to use as a blueprint for creating additional virtual machines.

⁠

**Procedure 4.20. Creating a Template from an Existing Virtual Machine**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Ensure the virtual machine is powered down and has a status of `Down`.
3.  Click **Make Template** to open the **New Template** window.
    ![The New Template window](New Template.png "fig:The New Template window")
    **Figure 4.10. The New Template window**
4.  Enter a **Name**, **Description**, and **Comment** for the template.
5.  From the **Cluster** drop-down menu, select the cluster with which the template will be associated. By default, this will be the same as that of the source virtual machine.
6.  Optionally, select the **Create as a Sub Template version** check box, select a **Root Template** and enter a **Sub Version Name** to create the new template as a sub template of an existing template.
7.  In the **Disks Allocation** section, enter an alias for the disk in the **Alias** text field and select the storage domain on which the disk will be stored from the **Target** drop-down list. By default, these will be the same as those of the source virtual machine.
8.  The **Allow all users to access this Template** check box is selected by default. This makes the template public.
9.  The **Copy VM permissions** check box is not selected by default. Select this check box to copy the permissions of the source virtual machine to the template.
10. Click **OK**.

**Result**

The virtual machine displays a status of `Image Locked` while the template is being created. The process of creating a template may take up to an hour depending on the size of the virtual machine disk and your storage hardware. When complete, the template is added to the **Templates** tab. You can now create new virtual machines based on the template.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** When a template is made, the virtual machine is copied so that both the existing virtual machine and its template are usable after template creation.

</div>
##### Editing a Template

**Summary**

Once a template has been created, its properties can be edited. Because a template is a copy of a virtual machine, the options available when editing a template are identical to those in the **Edit Virtual Machine** window.

⁠

The properties of the template are updated. The **Edit Template** window will not close if a property field is invalid.

##### Deleting a Template

**Summary**

Delete a template from your oVirt environment.

**Warning**

If you have used a template to create a virtual machine, make sure that you do not delete the template as the virtual machine needs it to continue running.

⁠

**Procedure 4.22. Deleting a Template**

1.  Use the resource tabs, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the template in the results list.
2.  Click **Remove** to open the **Remove Template(s)** window.
3.  Click **OK** to remove the template.

**Result**

You have removed the template.

#### Templates and Permissions

##### Managing System Permissions for a Template

As the **SuperUser**, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a **DataCenterAdmin** role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a **ClusterAdmin** has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.

A template administrator is a system administration role for templates in a data center. This role can be applied to specific virtual machines, to a data center, or to the whole virtualized environment; this is useful to allow different users to manage certain virtual resources.

The template administrator role permits the following actions:

*   Create, edit, export, and remove associated templates.
*   Import and export templates.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can only assign roles and permissions to existing users.

</div>
### Resources

#### Monitoring Power User Portal Resources

Before making configuration changes to virtual machines in the User Portal, it is recommended that you take an inventory of the resources available. This is to ensure the resources are sufficient for peak performance and to avoid overloading the hosts running the virtual machines.

The **Resources** tab in the navigation pane shows a cumulative view of all the resources available in the User Portal, and the performance and statistics of each virtual machine.

![Resources tab](Resource Tab.png "Resources tab")

**Figure 4.11. Resources tab**

*   **Virtual CPUs**: This box displays the number of your machines' virtual CPUs in use, and the consumption of CPU quota used by you and others.
*   **Memory**: This box displays the consumption of memory quota used by you and others, and available memory as defined by the quota.
*   **Storage**: This box displays the consumption of storage quota by you and others, the total size of all your virtual disks, and the number and total size of your virtual machines' snapshots. It also displays a breakdown of storage details for each virtual machine. Click the **+** button next to the virtual machine name to display all the virtual disks attached to the virtual machine.

#### Quota - A User's Introduction

When you create a virtual machine, the virtual machine consumes CPU and storage resources from its data center. Quota compares the amount of virtual resources consumed by the creation of the virtual machine to the storage allowance and the run-time allowance set by the system administrator.

If you do not have enough of either kind of allowance, you are not allowed to create the virtual machine. Avoid exceeding your quota limit by using the Resources tab to monitor your CPU and storage consumption.

#### What to Do When You Exceed Your Quota

oVirt provides a resource-limitation tool called *quota*, which allows system administrators to limit the amount of CPU and storage each user can consume. Quota compares the amount of virtual resources consumed when you use the virtual machine to the storage allowance and the run-time allowance set by the system administrator.

When you exceed your quota, a pop-up window informs you that you have exceeded your quota, and you will no longer have access to virtual resources. For example, this can happen if you have too many concurrently running virtual machines in your environment.

To regain access to your virtual machines, do one of the following:

*   Shut down the virtual machines that you do not need. This will bring your resource consumption down to a level at which it is not in excess of the quota, and you will be able to run virtual machines again.
*   If you cannot shut down any existing virtual machines, contact your system administrator to extend your quota allowance or remove any unused virtual machines.

### Virtual Machines and Permissions

#### Managing System Permissions for a Virtual Machine

As the **SuperUser**, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a **DataCenterAdmin** role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a **ClusterAdmin** has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.

A **UserVmManager** is a system administration role for virtual machines in a data center. This role can be applied to specific virtual machines, to a data center, or to the whole virtualized environment; this is useful to allow different users to manage certain virtual resources.

The user virtual machine administrator role permits the following actions:

*   Create, edit, and remove virtual machines.
*   Run, suspend, shutdown, and stop virtual machines.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can only assign roles and permissions to existing users.

</div>
Many end users are concerned solely with the virtual machine resources of the virtualized environment. As a result, oVirt provides several user roles which enable the user to manage virtual machines specifically, but not other resources in the data center.

#### Assigning Virtual Machines to Users

If you are creating virtual machines for users other than yourself, you have to assign roles to the users before they can use the virtual machines. Note that permissions can only be assigned to existing users. See the *oVirt Installation Guide* for details on creating user accounts.

The oVirt User Portal supports three default roles: User, PowerUser and UserVmManager. However, customized roles can be configured via oVirt Administration Portal. The default roles are described below.

*   A **User** can connect to and use virtual machines. This role is suitable for desktop end users performing day-to-day tasks.
*   A **PowerUser** can create virtual machines and view virtual resources. This role is suitable if you are an administrator or manager who needs to provide virtual resources for your employees.
*   A **UserVmManager** can edit and remove virtual machines, assign user permissions, use snapshots and use templates. It is suitable if you need to make configuration changes to your virtual environment.

When you create a virtual machine, you automatically inherit **UserVmManager** privileges. This enables you to make changes to the virtual machine and assign permissions to the users you manage, or users who are in your Identity Management (IdM) or RHDS group.

See *oVirt Installation Guide* for more information on directory services support in oVirt.

**Summary**

This procedure explains how to add permissions to users.

⁠

**Procedure 4.23. Assigning Permissions to Users**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  On the details pane, select the **Permissions** tab.
3.  Click **New**. The **Add Permission to User** dialog displays. Enter a Name, or User Name, or part thereof in the **Search** text box, and click **Go**. A list of possible matches display in the results list.
4.  Select the check box of the user to be assigned the permissions. Scroll through the **Role to Assign** list and select **UserRole**. Click **OK**.
5.  The user's name and role display in the list of users permitted to access this virtual machine.

**Result**

You have added permissions to a user.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** If a user is assigned permissions to only one virtual machine, Single Sign On (SSO) can be configured for the virtual machine. SSO enables the user to bypass the User Portal and log in directly to the virtual machine. SSO can be enabled or disabled via the User Portal on a per virtual machine basis.

</div>

**Result**

You have now removed permissions from a user.

## ⁠Configuring Console Options

### Console Options

#### Introduction to Connection Protocols

Connection protocols are the underlying technology used to provide graphical consoles for virtual machines and allow users to work with virtual machines in a similar way as they would with physical machines. oVirt currently supports the following connection protocols:

**SPICE**

Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is the recommended connection protocol for both Linux virtual machines and Windows virtual machines. SPICE is installed and executed on the client that connects to the virtual machine.

**VNC**

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) can be used to open consoles to both Linux virtual machines and Windows virtual machines. To open a console to a virtual machine using VNC, you must use Remote Viewer or a VNC client.

**RDP**

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) can only be used to open consoles to Windows virtual machines, and is only available when you access a virtual machines from a Windows machine on which Remote Desktop has been installed. Moreover, before you can connect to a Windows virtual machine using RDP, you must set up remote sharing on the virtual machine and configure the firewall to allow remote desktop connections.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** SPICE is not currently supported on virtual machines running Windows 8. If a Windows 8 virtual machine is configured to use the SPICE protocol, it will detect the absence of the required SPICE drivers and automatically fall back to using RDP.

</div>
#### Accessing Console Options

In the User Portal, you can configure several options for opening graphical consoles for virtual machines, such as the method of invocation and whether to enable or disable USB redirection.

**Procedure 5.1. Accessing Console Options**

## ⁠Configuring USB Devices

### Using USB Devices on Virtual Machines - Introduction

A virtual machine connected with the SPICE protocol can be configured to connect directly to USB devices.

The USB device will only be redirected if the virtual machine is active and in focus. USB redirection can be manually enabled each time a device is plugged in or set to automatically redirect to active virtual machines in the SPICE client menu.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Note the distinction between the client machine and guest machine. The client is the hardware from which you access a guest. The guest is the virtual desktop or virtual server which is accessed through the User Portal.

</div>
### Using USB Devices on Virtual Machines - Native Mode

USB redirection Native mode allows KVM/SPICE USB redirection for Linux and Windows virtual machines. Virtual (guest) machines require no guest-installed agents or drivers for native USB. All packages required by the client are brought forward by the SPICE xpi Firefox plugin. The USBClerk package must be installed on the Windows client. Native USB mode is supported on the following clients and guests:

*   Client
    -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and higher
    -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 and higher
    -   Windows XP
    -   Windows 7
    -   Windows 2008
    -   Windows 2008 Server R2
*   Guest
    -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and higher
    -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 and higher
    -   Windows XP
    -   Windows 7
    -   Windows 2008

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** If you have a 64-bit architecture PC, you must use the 64-bit version of Internet Explorer to install the 64-bit version of the USB driver. The USB redirection will not work if you install the 32-bit version on a 64-bit architecture. As long as you initially install the correct USB type, you then can access USB redirection from both 32 and 64-bit browsers.

</div>
### Using USB Devices on a Windows Client

The **usbclerk** service must be running on the Windows client for the USB device to be redirected to the guest. Ensure the version of **usbclerk** matches the architecture of the client machine. For example, the 64-bit version of **usbclerk** must be installed on 64-bit Windows machines.

**Procedure 7.1. Using USB Devices on a Windows Client**

1.  When the **usbclerk** service is installed and running, select a virtual machine that has been configured to use the SPICE protocol.
2.  Ensure USB support is set to **Native**:

<!-- -->

1.  Click the **Edit** button to open the **Edit Virtual Machine** window.
2.  Click the **Console** tab.
3.  From the **USB Support** drop-down menu, select **Native**.
4.  Click **OK**.

<li>

</li>
<li>
Start the virtual machine and click the **Console** button to connect to that virtual machine. When you plug your USB device into the client machine, it will automatically be redirected to appear on your guest machine.

</li>
</ol>
### Using USB Devices on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS Client

The usbredir package enables USB redirection from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or similar clients to virtual machines. usbredir is a dependency of the spice-xpi package, and is automatically installed together with that package.

**Procedure 7.2. Using USB devices on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOSclient**

</li>
</ol>
### Using USB Devices on Virtual Machines - Legacy Mode

Legacy mode for USB redirection enables the SPICE USB redirection policy used in oVirt 3.0. Legacy mode must be manually configured.

Legacy USB mode is supported on the following clients and guests:

*   Client
    -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and higher
    -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 and higher
    -   Windows XP
    -   Windows 7
    -   Windows 2008
*   Guest
    -   Windows XP
    -   Windows 7

#### Configuring a Linux Client to Use USB Redirection in Legacy Mode

If you connect to a virtual guest from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux client machine, you have to install several SPICE packages before you can share USB devices between the client and the guest.

**Procedure 7.3. Using USB devices on Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients:**

1.  Install SPICE packages on client
     On your Linux client machine, install the following packages:
    -   spice-usb-share
    -   kmod-kspiceusb-rhel60 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or
    -   kmod-kspiceusb-rhel5u6 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

     These packages are available on the Red Hat Network, from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Supplementary Software channel for your version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. To install the packages, run:
     # yum install spice-usb-share kmod-kspiceusb

2.  Run SPICE USB services
    Start the **spiceusbsrvd** service and load the **kspiceusb** module. Run:
     # service spiceusbsrvd start
    `   # modprobe kspiceusb`

3.  Install RHEV-Tools on guest
     Locate the CD drive to access the contents of the Guest Tools ISO, and launch `RHEV-ToolsSetup.exe`. If the Guest Tools ISO is not available in your CD drive, contact your system administrator. After the tools have been installed, you will be prompted to restart the machine for changes to be applied.
4.  Open firewall ports
     Allow connections on TCP port 32023 on any firewalls between the guest machine and the client machine.
5.  Enable USB Auto-Share
    On the User Portal, select your guest machine. Ensure that you have enabled SPICE USB Auto-Share on the guest machine.
6.  Attach USB device
     Connect to your guest machine. Place the SPICE console window of your guest desktop in focus, then attach a USB device to the client. The USB device displays in your guest desktop.
    ![List of Connected USB devices - Linux Client](List of Connected Devices.png "List of Connected USB devices - Linux Client")

    **Figure 7.1. List of Connected USB devices - Linux Client**

When you close the SPICE session the USB device will no longer be shared with the guest.

#### Configuring a Windows Client to Use USB Redirection in Legacy Mode

If you are connecting from a Windows client machine, and wish to use USB devices on your guest, you have to enable SPICE USB redirection.

**Procedure 7.4. Enabling USB redirection on Windows:**

1.  Install USB redirector package on client
    On a Windows client machine, install `oVirt-USB-Client.exe`.
2.  Install RHEV-Tools on guest
    Locate the CD drive to access the contents of the Guest Tools ISO, and launch `oVirt-ToolsSetup.exe`. If the Guest Tools ISO is not available in your CD drive, contact your system administrator. After the tools have been installed, you will be prompted to restart the machine for changes to be applied.
3.  Open firewall ports
    Allow connections on TCP port 32023 on any firewalls between the guest machine and the client machine.
4.  Enable USB sharing On the User Portal, select your guest machine. Ensure that you have enabled SPICE USB sharing on the guest machine.
5.  Attach USB device Connect to your guest machine and attach a USB device to the client. If the required USB device does not appear directly on the guest desktop, right-click on the SPICE frame and select USB Devices. Choose your device from the list displayed.
    ![List of Connected USB devices - Windows Client](List of Connected Devices-Windows.png "List of Connected USB devices - Windows Client")

    **Figure 7.2. List of Connected USB devices - Windows Client**

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** When some USB devices are connected on Windows clients, the autoplay window will appear and the client will take control of the device, making it unavailable to the guest. To avoid this issue, disable USB autoplay on your Windows clients.

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can also define additional USB policies for Windows clients, to allow or block access to certain USB devices. For details, see the sections on USB Filter Editor in the [oVirt Administration Guide](OVirt_Administration_Guide).

</div>
## Configuring Single Sign-On

### Configuring Single Sign-On for Virtual Machines

Configuring single sign-on allows you to automatically log in to a virtual machine using the credentials you use to log in to the User Portal. Single sign-on can be used on both Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS and Windows virtual machines.

### Configuring Single Sign-On for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtual Machines Using IPA (IdM)

To configure single sign-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines using GNOME and KDE graphical desktop environments and IPA (IdM) servers, you must install the ovirt-guest-agent package on the virtual machine and install the packages associated with your window manager.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** The following procedure assumes that you have a working IPA configuration and that the IPA domain is already joined to the Manager. You must also ensure that the clocks on the Manager, the virtual machine and the system on which IPA (IdM) is hosted are synchronized using NTP.

</div>
**Procedure 8.1. Configuring Single Sign-On for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtual Machines**

1.  Log in to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine.
2.  Run the following command to enable the required channel:
        # rhn-channel --add --channel=rhel-x86_64-rhev-agent-6-server

3.  Run the following command to download and install the guest agent packages:
        # yum install rhevm-guest-agent

4.  Run the following commands to install the single sign-on packages:
        # yum install rhev-agent-pam-rhev-cred
        # yum install rhev-agent-gdm-plugin-rhevcred

5.  Run the following command to install the IPA packages:
        # yum install ipa-client

6.  Run the following command and follow the prompts to configure **ipa-client** and join the virtual machine to the domain:
        # ipa-client-install --permit --mkhomedir

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Note:** In environments that use DNS obfuscation, this command should be:

        # ipa-client-install --domain=[FQDN] --server==[FQDN]

    </div>
7.  Fetch the details of an IPA user:
        # getent passwd [IPA user name]

8.  This will return something like this:
        [some-ipa-user]:*:936600010:936600001::/home/[some-ipa-user]:/bin/sh

    You will need this information in the next step to create a home directory for [some-ipa-user].

9.  Set up a home directory for the IPA user:
    1.  Create the new user's home directory:
            # mkdir /home/[some-ipa-user]

    2.  Give the new user ownership of the new user's home directory:
            # chown 935500010:936600001 /home/[some-ipa-user]

**Result**

You have enabled single sign-on for your Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine. Log in to the User Portal using the user name and password of a user configured to use single sign-on and connect to the console of the virtual machine. You will be logged in automatically.

### Configuring Single Sign-On for Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS Virtual Machines Using Active Directory

To configure single sign-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS virtual machines using GNOME and KDE graphical desktop environments and Active Directory, you must install the ovirt-guest-agent package on the virtual machine, install the packages associated with your window manager and join the virtual machine to the domain.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** The following procedure assumes that you have a working Active Directory configuration and that the Active Directory domain is already joined to the Manager. You must also ensure that the clocks on the Manager, the virtual machine and the system on which Active Directory is hosted are synchronized using NTP.

</div>
⁠ **Procedure 8.2. Configuring Single Sign-On for Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS Virtual Machines**

1.  Log in to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS virtual machine.
2.  Run the following command to enable the required channel:
        # rhn-channel --add --channel=rhel-x86_64-rhev-agent-6-server

3.  Run the following command to download and install the guest agent packages:
        # yum install ovirt-guest-agent

4.  Run the following command to install the single sign-on packages:
        # yum install ovirt-agent-gdm-plugin-rhevcred

5.  Run the following command to install the Samba client packages:
        # yum install samba-client samba-winbind samba-winbind-clients

6.  On the virtual machine, modify the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file to contain the following, replacing `DOMAIN` with the short domain name and `REALM.LOCAL` with the Active Directory realm:
        [global]
               workgroup = DOMAIN
               realm = REALM.LOCAL
               log level = 2
               syslog = 0
               server string = Linux File Server
               security = ads
               log file = /var/log/samba/%m
               max log size = 50
               printcap name = cups
               printing = cups
               winbind enum users = Yes
               winbind enum groups = Yes
               winbind use default domain = true
               winbind separator = +
               idmap uid = 1000000-2000000
               idmap gid = 1000000-2000000
               template shell = /bin/bash

7.  Run the following command to join the virtual machine to the domain:
        net ads join -U [user name]

8.  Run the following command to start the **winbind** service and ensure it starts on boot:
        # service winbind start
        # chkconfig winbind on

9.  Run the following commands to verify that the system can communicate with Active Directory:
    -   Verify that a trust relationship has been created:
            # wbinfo -t

    -   Verify that you can list users:
            # wbinfo -u

    -   Verify that you can list groups:
            # wbinfo -g

10. Run the following command to configure the NSS and PAM stack:
    1.  Run the following command to open the **Authentication Configuration** window:
            # authconfig-tui

    2.  Select the '''Use Winbind check box, select **Next** and press **Enter**.
    3.  Select the **OK** button and press **Enter**.

**Result**

You have enabled single sign-on for your Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine. Log in to the User Portal using the user name and password of a user configured to use single sign-on and connect to the console of the virtual machine. You will be logged in automatically.

### Configuring Single Sign-On for Windows Virtual Machines

To configure single sign-on for Windows virtual machines, the Windows guest agent must be installed on the guest virtual machine. The `oVirt Guest Tools ISO` file provides this agent. If the `oVirt-toolsSetup.iso` image is not available in your ISO domain, contact your system administrator. ⁠

**Procedure 8.3. Configuring Single Sign-On for Windows Virtual Machines**

1.  From the **Extended** tab of the User Portal, select the Windows virtual machine. Ensure the machine is powered up, then click the **Change CD** button.
2.  From the list of images, select `oVirt-toolsSetup.iso`. Click **OK**.
3.  Once you have attached the guest tools, click the **Console** icon and log in to the virtual machine.
4.  On the virtual machine, locate the CD drive to access the contents of the guest tools ISO file and launch **oVirt-ToolsSetup.exe**. After the tools have been installed, you will be prompted to restart the machine to apply the changes.

**Result**

You have enabled single sign-on for your Windows virtual machine. Log in to the User Portal using the user name and password of a user configured to use single sign-on and connect to the console of the virtual machine. You will be logged in automatically.
