# oVirt 4.2.6 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.6 release as of September 03, 2018.

Release has been updated on September 13, 2018.

Release has been updated on October 4th, 2018 with a new oVirt Node consuming CentOS 7.5 updates.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5,
CentOS Linux 7.5 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.6, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### No Fedora support

Regretfully, Fedora is not supported anymore, and RPMs for it are not provided.
These are still built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
At this point, we only try to fix problems specific to Fedora if they affect
developers. For some of the work to be done to restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## Known Issues
- With oVirt Node 4.2.6 IP over infiniband is not working anymore after an upgrade, due to kernel
  3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64.
  You can find some detail here: https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=15193.
  An async release will be issued as soon as a new kernel will be available.


## What's New in 4.2.6?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1457250](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1457250) <b>[RFE] Provide Live Migration for VMs based on "High Performance VM" Profile - manual migrations</b><br>Feature: <br>This feature provides the ability to enable the live migration for those HP VMs (and in general to all VM types with pinning settings).<br><br>Reason: <br>n oVirt 4.2 we added a new “High Performance” VM profile type. This required configuration settings includes pinning the VM to a host based on the host specific configuration. Due to that pinning settings, the migration option for the HP VM type was automatically forced to be disabled.<br><br>Result: <br>in oVirt 4.2.x we will provide the ability to manual migrate the HP VM. This is the first phase solution as mentioned in the feature page.<br>In next oVirt release 4.2 we will provide a full automatic solution.<br><br>This solution for 4.2.x includes:<br>1. Only manual migration can be done for HP VMs via the UI. In addition the user will have to choose the destination host to migrate to.<br>2. Manual migration is also supported for Server/Desktop VM types with pinned configuration, but only via REST api.<br><br>For more details on this first phase/manual solution, please refer to the feature page: https://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/virt/high-performance-vm-migration/
 - [BZ 1590967](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1590967) <b>[RFE] Display space savings when a VDO volume is used.</b><br>Feature: Reporting VDO space savings on the Storage domains, gluster volumes and bricks<br><br>Reason: Good to know it.<br><br>Result: Storage Domain view, Volume view and Brick view now include a 'VDO savings' field with savings percent.
 - [BZ 1393372](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1393372) <b>iscsi: request and parse ipv6 targets from vdsm (in clusterLevel>=4.1) - engine side</b><br>Feature: <br>Discover and login to ipv6 addresses while creating a new iSCSI storage domain.<br><br>Reason: <br>In case of trying to discover an ipv6 address, there's an error message. Therefore only discovery for ipv4 is being supported today.<br><br>Result:<br>The user can successfully discover ipv6 addresses.<br>This is enabled by default on clusterLevel >=4.3, but may be enabled manually on clusterLevel=4.2 if all of your hosts are >= 4.2.6 with<br><br> engine-config -s ipv6IscsiSupported=true --cver=4.2
 - [BZ 1558847](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1558847) <b>[RFE] Sync all networks across all hosts in cluster</b><br>Previously, if a host's networks network definitions became unsynchronized with the definitions on the Manager, there was no way to synchronize all unsynchronized hosts on the cluster level.<br>In this release, a new Sync All Networks button has been added to the Cluster screen in the Administration Portal that enables users to synchronize all unsynchronized hosts with the definitions defined on the Manager.
 - [BZ 1565541](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1565541) <b>packaging: Ansible playbook to set ovn cluster tunnel should accept long network names</b><br>Previously, it was not possible to define long network names when modifying the tunnelling network for OVN controllers.<br><br>In this release, a script has been provided to enable long network names to be used for tunnelling network definitions.
 - [BZ 1625171](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1625171) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.6] [RFE] Should be able to change the Port number of NoVnc</b><br>
 - [BZ 1596151](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1596151) <b>enable migration for cpu pinned VMs</b><br>Remove the config parameter called "CpuPinMigrationEnabled" (appears on DB in vdc_options table) in downstream and upstream installations. <br>This change was done to support High Performance VM live migration (BZ 1457250)

#### oVirt Setup Lib

 - [BZ 1295041](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1295041) <b>[RFE] add IPv6 support to ovirt-setup-lib</b><br>Previously, the engine-setup tool did not support host names that only resolved to an IPv6 address.<br>In this release, the engine-setup tool supports host names that only resolve to an IPv6 address.

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1608467](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1608467) <b>[TEXT] - the deployment will fail late if firewalld is disabled or masked on the host</b><br>Self-hosted engine deployment fails if firewalld is masked on the host. This is now checked earlier in the deployment script.

#### oVirt Engine Metrics

 - [BZ 1607127](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1607127) <b>[RFE] Update ansible-inventory file to use latest instead of version</b><br>The current release always uses the latest Ansible inventory file, so that a particular Openshift version no longer needs to be specified and the documentation is always up to date.
