# oVirt Administration Guide

## Introduction

### oVirt Architecture

An oVirt environment consists of:

*   Virtual machine **hosts** using the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).
*   **Agents and tools** running on hosts including VDSM, QEMU, and libvirt. These tools provide local management for virtual machines, networks and storage.
*   **oVirt**; a centralized management platform for the oVirt environment. It provides a graphical interface where you can view, provision and manage resources.
*   **Storage domains** to hold virtual resources like virtual machines, templates, ISOs.
*   A **database** to track the state of and changes to the environment.
*   Access to an external **Directory Server** to provide users and authentication.
*   **Networking** to link the environment together. This includes physical network links, and logical networks.

**Figure 1.1. oVirt Platform Overview**

### oVirt System Components

The oVirt version 3.4 environment consists of one or more hosts (either Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or later hosts (or similar), Fedora 19, or oVirt Node 6.5 or later hosts) and at least one instance of oVirt.

Hosts run virtual machines using KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) virtualization technology.

oVirt runs on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (or similar) server, as well as Fedora 19, and provides interfaces for controlling the oVirt environment. It manages virtual machine and storage provisioning, connection protocols, user sessions, virtual machine images, and high-availability virtual machines.

oVirt is accessed through the Administration Portal using a web browser.

### oVirt Resources

The components of the oVirt environment fall into two categories: physical resources, and logical resources. Physical resources are physical objects, such as host and storage servers. Logical resources are nonphysical groupings and processes, such as logical networks and virtual machine templates.

*   **Data Center** - A data center is the highest-level container for all physical and logical resources within a managed virtual environment. It is a collection of clusters, virtual machines, storage, and networks.
*   **Clusters** - A cluster is a set of physical hosts that are treated as a resource pool for virtual machines. Hosts in a cluster share the same network infrastructure and storage. They form a migration domain within which virtual machines can be moved from host to host.
*   **Logical Networks** - A logical network is a logical representation of a physical network. Logical networks group network traffic and communication between oVirt, hosts, storage, and virtual machines.
*   **Hosts** - A host is a physical server that runs one or more virtual machines. Hosts are grouped into clusters. Virtual machines can be migrated from one host to another within a cluster.
*   **Storage Pool** - The storage pool is a logical entity that contains a standalone image repository of a certain type, either iSCSI, Fibre Channel, NFS, or POSIX. Each storage pool can contain several domains, for storing virtual machine disk images, ISO images, and for the import and export of virtual machine images.
*   **Virtual Machines** - A virtual machine is a virtual desktop or virtual server containing an operating system and a set of applications. Multiple identical virtual machines can be created in a **Pool**. Virtual machines are created, managed, or deleted by power users and accessed by users.
*   **Template** - A template is a model virtual machine with predefined settings. A virtual machine that is based on a particular template acquires the settings of the template. Using templates is the quickest way of creating a large number of virtual machines in a single step.
*   **Virtual Machine Pool** - A virtual machine pool is a group of identical virtual machines that are available on demand by each group member. Virtual machine pools can be set up for different purposes. For example, one pool can be for the Marketing department, another for Research and Development, and so on.
*   **Snapshot** - A snapshot is a view of a virtual machine's operating system and all its applications at a point in time. It can be used to save the settings of a virtual machine before an upgrade or installing new applications. In case of problems, a snapshot can be used to restore the virtual machine to its original state.
*   **User Types** - oVirt supports multiple levels of administrators and users with distinct levels of permissions. System administrators can manage objects of the physical infrastructure, such as data centers, hosts, and storage. Users access virtual machines available from a virtual machine pool or standalone virtual machines made accessible by an administrator.
*   **Events and Monitors** - Alerts, warnings, and other notices about activities help the administrator to monitor the performance and status of resources.
*   **Reports** - A range of reports either from the reports module based on JasperReports, or from the data warehouse. Preconfigured or ad hoc reports can be generated from the reports module. Users can also generate reports using any query tool that supports SQL from a data warehouse that collects monitoring data for hosts, virtual machines, and storage.

### oVirt API Support Statement

oVirt exposes a number of interfaces for interacting with the components of the virtualization environment. These interfaces are in addition to the user interfaces provided by oVirt Administration, User, and Reports Portals. Many of these interfaces are fully supported. Some, however, are supported only for read access.

**Supported Interfaces for Read and Write Access**

Direct interaction with these interfaces is supported and encouraged for both read and write access:

Representational State Transfer (REST) API  
The REST API exposed by oVirt is a fully supported interface for interacting with oVirt.

Software Development Kit (SDK)  
The SDK provided by the python-sdk and java-sdk packages is a fully supported interface for interacting with oVirt.

Command Line Shell  
The command line shell provided by the ovirt-shell package is a fully supported interface for interacting with oVirt.

VDSM Hooks  
The creation and use of VDSM hooks to trigger modification of virtual machines based on custom properties specified in the Administration Portal is supported on oVirt hosts. The use of VDSM Hooks on virtualization hosts running oVirt Node is not currently supported.

**Supported Interfaces for Read Access**

Direct interaction with these interfaces is supported and encouraged only for read access. Use of these interfaces for write access is not supported:

oVirt History Database  
Read access to oVirt history database using the database views specified in the Administration Guide is supported. Write access is *not* supported.

Libvirt on Virtualization Hosts  
Read access to `libvirt` using the `virsh -r` command is a supported method of interacting with virtualization hosts. Write access is *not* supported.

**Unsupported Interfaces**

Direct interaction with these interfaces is *not* supported:

The vdsClient Command  
Use of the `vdsClient` command to interact with virtualization hosts is *not* supported.

oVirt Node Console  
Console access to oVirt Node outside of the provided text user interface for configuration is *not* supported.

oVirt Database  
Direct access to and manipulation of oVirt database is *not* supported.

### Administering and Maintaining the oVirt Environment

The oVirt environment requires an administrator to keep it running. As an administrator, your tasks include:

*   Managing physical and virtual resources such as hosts and virtual machines. This includes upgrading and adding hosts, importing domains, converting virtual machines created on foreign hypervisors, and managing virtual machine pools.
*   Monitoring the overall system resources for potential problems such as extreme load on one of the hosts, insufficient memory or disk space, and taking any necessary actions (such as migrating virtual machines to other hosts to lessen the load or freeing resources by shutting down machines).
*   Responding to the new requirements of virtual machines (for example, upgrading the operating system or allocating more memory).
*   Managing customized object properties using tags.
*   Managing searches saved as public bookmarks.
*   Managing user setup and setting permission levels.
*   Troubleshooting for specific users or virtual machines for overall system functionality.
*   Generating general and specific reports.

## Using the Administration Portal

### Graphical User Interface Elements

The oVirt Administration Portal consists of contextual panes and menus and can be used in two modes - tree mode, and flat mode. Tree mode allows you to browse the object hierarchy of a data center while flat mode allows you to view all resources across data centers in a single list. The elements of the graphical user interface are shown in the diagram below.

⁠

![Key Graphical User Interface Elements](Admin-portal-label.png "Key Graphical User Interface Elements")

**Figure 2.1. Key Graphical User Interface Elements**

**Key Graphical User Interface Elements**

*   ![](Bullet1.png "fig:Bullet1.png")
    **Header**
    The header bar contains the name of the currently logged in user, the **Sign Out** button, the **About** button, the **Configure** button, and the **Guide** button. The **About** shows information on the version of oVirt, the **Configure** button allows you to configure user roles, and the **Guide** button provides a shortcut to the book you are reading now.
    **Search Bar**
    The search bar allows you to build queries for finding resources such as hosts and clusters in the oVirt environment. Queries can be as simple as a list of all the hosts in the system, or more complex, such as a list of resources that match certain conditions. As you type each part of the search query, you are offered choices to assist you in building the search. The star icon can be used to save the search as a bookmark.
*   ![](Bullet2.png "fig:Bullet2.png")
    **System/Bookmarks/Tags Pane**
    The system pane displays a navigable hierarchy of the resources in the virtualized environment. Bookmarks are used to save frequently used or complicated searches for repeated use. Bookmarks can be added, edited, or removed. Tags are applied to groups of resources and are used to search for all resources associated with that tag. The System/Bookmarks/Tags Pane can be minimized using the arrow in the upper right corner of the panel.
*   ![](Bullet3.png "fig:Bullet3.png")
    **Resource Tabs**
    All resources can be managed using their associated tab. Moreover, the **Events** tab allows you to view events for each resource. The Administration Portal provides the following tabs: **Data Centers**, **Clusters**, **Hosts**, **Networks**, **Storage**, **Disks**, **Virtual Machines**, **Pools**, **Templates**, **Volumes**, **Users**, and **Events**, and a **Dashboard** tab if you have installed the data warehouse and reports.
*   ![](Bullet4.png "fig:Bullet4.png")
    **Results List**
    You can perform a task on an individual item, multiple items, or all the items in the results list by selecting the items and clicking the relevant action button. Information on a selected item is displayed in the details pane.
     **Refresh Rate**
    The refresh rate drop-down menu at the top of the Results List allows you to set the time, in seconds, between Administration Portal refreshes. To avoid the delay between a user performing an action and the result appearing the portal, the portal will automatically refresh upon an action or event regardless of the chosen refresh interval. You can set this interval by clicking the refresh symbol in top right of the portal.
*   ![](Bullet5.png "fig:Bullet5.png")
    **Details Pane**
    The details pane shows detailed information about a selected item in the results list. If no items are selected, this pane is hidden. If multiple items are selected, the details pane displays information on the first selected item only.
     **Alerts/Events Pane**
    Below the Details pane, the **Alerts** tab lists all high severity events such as errors or warnings. The **Events** tab shows a list of events for all resources. The **Tasks** tab lists the currently running tasks. You can view this panel by clicking the maximize/minimize button.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** The minimum supported resolution viewing the Administration Portal in a web browser is 1024x768. The Administration Portal will not render correctly when viewed at a lower resolution.

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** In oVirt 3.4, the web user interface display has been improved to allow the Administration Portal to render correctly at low resolutions or on non-maximized windows. When resolution is too low or window space insufficient to hold all menu tabs, you are able to scroll the tabs left or right, and access a drop down menu that lists all tabs. The **System/Bookmarks/Tags Pane** can also be minimized to allow additional space.

</div>

### Tree Mode and Flat Mode

The Administration Portal provides two different modes for managing your resources: tree mode and flat mode. Tree mode displays resources in a hierarchical view per data center, from the highest level of the data center down to the individual virtual machine. Working in tree mode is highly recommended for most operations.

⁠

![Tree Mode|250px](Tree_mode.png "Tree Mode|250px")

**Figure 2.2. Tree Mode**

Flat mode allows you to search across data centers, or storage domains. It does not limit you to viewing the resources of a single hierarchy. For example, you may need to find all virtual machines that are using more than 80% CPU across clusters and data centers, or locate all hosts that have the highest utilization. Flat mode makes this possible. In addition, certain objects, such as **Pools** and **Users** are not in the data center hierarchy and can be accessed only in flat mode.

To access flat mode, click on the **System** item in the **Tree** pane on the left side of the screen. You are in flat mode if the **Pools** and **Users** resource tabs appear.

⁠

![Flat Mode|250px](Flat_mode.png "Flat Mode|250px")

**Figure 2.3. Flat Mode**

### Using the Guide Me Facility

When setting up resources such as data centers and clusters, a number of tasks must be completed in sequence. The context-sensitive **Guide Me** window prompts for actions that are appropriate to the resource being configured. The **Guide Me** window can be accessed at any time by clicking the **Guide Me** button on the resource toolbar.

⁠

![New Data Center Guide Me Window|300px](Guide_me.png "New Data Center Guide Me Window|300px")

**Figure 2.4. New Data Center Guide Me Window**

### Performing Searches in oVirt

The Administration Portal enables the management of thousands of resources, such as virtual machines, hosts, users, and more. To perform a search, enter the search query (free-text or syntax-based) in the search bar. Search queries can be saved as bookmarks for future reuse, so you do not have to reenter a search query each time the specific search results are needed.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** In versions prior to oVirt 3.4, searches in the Administration Portal were case sensitive. Now, the search bar supports case insensitive searches.

</div>

### Saving a Query String as a Bookmark

**Summary**

A bookmark can be used to remember a search query, and shared with other users.

⁠

**Procedure 2.1. Saving a Query String as a Bookmark**

1.  Enter the desired search query in the search bar and perform the search.
2.  Click the star-shaped **Bookmark** button to the right of the search bar to open the **New Bookmark** window.
    ⁠

    ![Bookmark Icon](Bookmark.png "Bookmark Icon")

    **Figure 2.5. Bookmark Icon**

3.  Enter the **Name** of the bookmark.
4.  Edit the **Search string** field (if applicable).
5.  Click **OK** to save the query as a bookmark and close the window.
6.  The search query is saved and displays in the **Bookmarks** pane.

**Result**

You have saved a search query as a bookmark for future reuse. Use the **Bookmark** pane to find and select the bookmark.

## ⁠Data Centers

### Introduction to Data Centers

A data center is a logical entity that defines the set of resources used in a specific environment. A data center is considered a container resource, in that it is comprised of logical resources, in the form of clusters and hosts; network resources, in the form of logical networks and physical NICs; and storage resources, in the form of storage domains.

A data center can contain multiple clusters, which can contain multiple hosts; it can have multiple storage domains associated to it; and it can support multiple virtual machines on each of its hosts. An oVirt environment can contain multiple data centers; the data center infrastructure allows you to keep these centers separate.

All data centers are managed from the single Administration Portal.

oVirt creates a default data center during installation. It is recommended that you do not remove the default data center; instead, set up new appropriately named data centers.

### The Storage Pool Manager

The Storage Pool Manager (SPM) is a role given to one of the hosts in the data center enabling it to manage the storage domains of the data center. The SPM entity can be run on any host in the data center; oVirt grants the role to one of the hosts. The SPM does not preclude the host from its standard operation; a host running as SPM can still host virtual resources.

The SPM entity controls access to storage by coordinating the metadata across the storage domains. This includes creating, deleting, and manipulating virtual disks (images), snapshots, and templates, and allocating storage for sparse block devices (on SAN). This is an exclusive responsibility: only one host can be the SPM in the data center at one time to ensure metadata integrity.

oVirt ensures that the SPM is always available. oVirt moves the SPM role to a different host if the SPM host encounters problems accessing the storage. When the SPM starts, it ensures that it is the only host granted the role; therefore it will acquire a storage-centric lease. This process can take some time.

### SPM Priority

The SPM role uses some of a host's available resources. The SPM priority setting of a host alters the likelihood of the host being assigned the SPM role: a host with high SPM priority will be assigned the SPM role before a host with low SPM priority. Critical virtual machines on hosts with low SPM priority will not have to contend with SPM operations for host resources.

You can change a host's SPM priority by editing the host.

### Using the Events Tab to Identify Problem Objects in Data Centers

The **Events** tab for a data center displays all events associated with that data center; events include audits, warnings, and errors. The information displayed in the results list will enable you to identify problem objects in your oVirt environment.

The **Events** results list has two views: Basic and Advanced. Basic view displays the event icon, the time of the event, and the description of the events. Advanced view displays these also and includes, where applicable, the event ID; the associated user, host, virtual machine, template, data center, storage, and cluster; the Gluster volume, and the correlation ID.

### Data Center Tasks

#### Creating a New Data Center

**Summary**

This procedure creates a data center in your virtualization environment. The data center requires a functioning cluster, host, and storage domain to operate.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** The storage **Type** can be edited until the first storage domain is added to the data center. Once a storage domain has been added, the storage **Type** cannot be changed.

If you set the **Compatibility Version** as **3.1**, it cannot be changed to **3.0** at a later time; version regression is not allowed.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 3.1. Creating a New Data Center**

1.  Select the **Data Centers** resource tab to list all data centers in the results list.
2.  Click **New** to open the **New Data Center** window.
3.  Enter the **Name** and **Description** of the data center.
4.  Select the storage **Type**, **Compatibility Version**, and **Quota Mode** of the data center from the drop-down menus.
5.  Click **OK** to create the data center and open the **New Data Center - Guide Me** window.
6.  The **Guide Me** window lists the entities that need to be configured for the data center. Configure these entities or postpone configuration by clicking the **Configure Later** button; configuration can be resumed by selecting the data center and clicking the **Guide Me** button.

**Result**

The new data center is added to the virtualization environment. It will remain **Uninitialized** until a cluster, host, and storage domain are configured for it; use **Guide Me** to configure these entities.

#### Explanation of Settings in the New Data Center and Edit Data Center Windows

The table below describes the settings of a data center as displayed in the **New Data Center** and **Edit Data Center** windows. Invalid entries are outlined in orange when you click **OK**, prohibiting the changes being accepted. In addition, field prompts indicate the expected values or range of values.

7.  Enter a new label or select an existing label for the logical network in the **Network Label** text field.
8.  From the **Cluster** tab, select the clusters to which the network will be assigned. You can also specify whether the logical network will be a required network.
9.  If the **Create on external provider** check box is selected, the **Subnet** tab will be visible. From the **Subnet** tab enter a **Name**, **CIDR** and select an **IP Version** for the subnet that the logical network will provide.
10. From the **Profiles** tab, add vNIC profiles to the logical network as required.
11. Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have defined a logical network as a resource required by a cluster or clusters in the data center. If you entered a label for the logical network, it will be automatically added to all host network interfaces with that label.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** When creating a new logical network or making changes to an existing logical network that is used as a display network, any running virtual machines that use that network must be rebooted before the network becomes available or the changes are applied.

</div>

#### Removing a Logical Network

**Summary**

Remove a logical network from oVirt.

⁠**Procedure 3.4. Removing Logical Networks**

1.  Use the **Data Centers** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the data center of the logical network in the results list.
2.  Click the **Logical Networks** tab in the details pane to list the logical networks in the data center.
3.  Select a logical network and click **Remove** to open the **Remove Logical Network(s)** window.
4.  Optionally, select the **Remove external network(s) from the provider(s) as well** check box to remove the logical network both from oVirt and from the external provider if the network is provided by an external provider.
5.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

The logical network is removed from oVirt and is no longer available. If the logical network was provided by an external provider and you elected to remove the logical network from that external provider, it is removed from the external provider and is no longer available on that external provider as well.

#### Re-Initializing a Data Center: Recovery Procedure

**Summary**

This recovery procedure replaces the master data domain of your data center with a new master data domain; necessary in the event of data corruption of your master data domain. Re-initializing a data center allows you to restore all other resources associated with the data center, including clusters, hosts, and non-problematic storage domains.

You can import any backup or exported virtual machines or templates into your new master data domain.

⁠

**Procedure 3.5. Re-Initializing a Data Center**

1.  Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the data center to re-initialize.
2.  Ensure that any storage domains attached to the data center are in maintenance mode.
3.  Right-click the data center and select **Re-Initialize Data Center** from the drop-down menu to open the **Data Center Re-Initialize** window.
4.  The **Data Center Re-Initialize** window lists all available (detached; in maintenance mode) storage domains. Click the radio button for the storage domain you are adding to the data center.
5.  Select the **Approve operation** check box.
6.  Click **OK** to close the window and re-initialize the data center.

**Result**

The storage domain is attached to the data center as the master data domain and activated. You can now import any backup or exported virtual machines or templates into your new master data domain.

#### Removing a Data Center

**Summary**

An active host is required to remove a data center. Removing a data center will not remove the associated resources.

⁠

**Procedure 3.6. Removing a Data Center**

1.  Ensure the storage domains attached to the data center is in maintenance mode.
2.  Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the data center to remove.
3.  Click **Remove** to open the **Remove Data Center(s)** confirmation window.
4.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

The data center has been removed.

#### Force Removing a Data Center

**Summary**

A data center becomes `Non Responsive` if the attached storage domain is corrupt or if the host becomes `Non Responsive`. You cannot **Remove** the data center under either circumstance.

**Force Remove** does not require an active host. It also permanently removes the attached storage domain.

It may be necessary to **Destroy** a corrupted storage domain before you can **Force Remove** the data center.

⁠

**Procedure 3.7. Force Removing a Data Center**

1.  Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the data center to remove.
2.  Click **Force Remove** to open the **Force Remove Data Center** confirmation window.
3.  Select the **Approve operation** check box.
4.  Click **OK**

**Result**

The data center and attached storage domain are permanently removed from the oVirt environment.

#### Changing the Data Center Compatibility Version

**Summary**

oVirt data centers have a compatibility version. The compatibility version indicates the version of oVirt that the data center is intended to be compatible with. All clusters in the data center must support the desired compatibility level.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** To change the data center compatibility version, you must have first updated all the clusters in your data center to a level that supports your desired compatibility level.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 3.8. Changing the Data Center Compatibility Version**

1.  Click the **Data Centers** resource tab and select the data center to remove.
2.  Select the data center to change from the list displayed. If the list of data centers is too long to filter visually, then perform a search to locate the desired data center.
3.  Click the **Edit** button.
4.  Change the **Compatibility Version** to the desired value.
5.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have updated the compatibility version of the data center.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Warning:** Upgrading the compatibility will also upgrade all of the storage domains belonging to the data center. If you are upgrading the compatibility version from below 3.1 to a higher version, these storage domains will become unusable with versions older than 3.1.

</div>

### Data Centers and Storage Domains

#### Attaching an Existing Data Domain to a Data Center

**Summary**

## ⁠Clusters

### Introduction to Clusters

A cluster is a logical grouping of hosts that share the same storage domains and have the same type of CPU (either Intel or AMD). If the hosts have different generations of CPU models, they use only the features present in all models.

Each cluster in the system must belong to a data center, and each host in the system must belong to a cluster. Virtual machines are dynamically allocated to any host in a cluster and can be migrated between them, according to policies defined on the **Clusters** tab and in the Configuration tool during runtime. The cluster is the highest level at which power and load-sharing policies can be defined.

Clusters run virtual machines or Red Hat Storage Servers. These two purposes are mutually exclusive: A single cluster cannot support virtualization and storage hosts together.

The oVirt platform installs a default cluster in the default data center by default during the installation process.

### Cluster Tasks

#### Creating a New Cluster

**Summary**

A data center can contain multiple clusters, and a cluster can contain multiple hosts. All hosts in a cluster must be of the same CPU type (Intel or AMD). It is recommended that you create your hosts before you create your cluster to ensure CPU type optimization. However, you can configure the hosts at a later time using the **Guide Me** button.

⁠

**Procedure 4.1. Creating a New Cluster**

1.  Select the **Clusters** resource tab.
2.  Click **New** to open the **New Cluster** window.
3.  Select the **Data Center** the cluster will belong to from the drop-down list.
4.  Enter the **Name** and **Description** of the cluster.
5.  Select the **CPU Name** and **Compatibility Version** from the drop-down lists. It is important to match the CPU processor family with the minimum CPU processor type of the hosts you intend to attach to the cluster, otherwise the host will be non-operational.
6.  Click the **Optimization** tab to select the memory page sharing threshold for the cluster, and optionally enable CPU thread handling, memory ballooning, and KSM control on the hosts in the cluster.
7.  Click the **Cluster Policy** tab to optionally configure a cluster policy, scheduler optimization settings, enable trusted service for hosts in the cluster, and enable HA Reservation.
8.  Click the **Resilience Policy** tab to select the virtual machine migration policy.
9.  Click the **Console** tab to optionally override the global SPICE proxy, if any, and specify the address of a SPICE proxy for hosts in the cluster.
10. Click **OK** to create the cluster and open the **New Cluster - Guide Me** window.
11. The **Guide Me** window lists the entities that need to be configured for the cluster. Configure these entities or postpone configuration by clicking the **Configure Later** button; configuration can be resumed by selecting the cluster and clicking the **Guide Me** button.

**Result**

The new cluster is added to the virtualization environment.

##### Optimization Settings Explained

Memory page sharing allows virtual machines to use up to 200% of their allocated memory by utilizing unused memory in other virtual machines. This process is based on the assumption that the virtual machines in your oVirt environment will not all be running at full capacity at the same time, allowing unused memory to be temporarily allocated to a particular virtual machine.

CPU Thread Handling allows hosts to run virtual machines with a total number of processor cores greater than number of cores in the host. This is useful for non-CPU-intensive workloads, where allowing a greater number of virtual machines to run can reduce hardware requirements. It also allows virtual machines to run with CPU topologies that would otherwise not be possible, specifically if the number of guest cores is between the number of host cores and number of host threads.

To have a balloon running, the virtual machine needs to have a balloon device with relevant drivers. Each virtual machine in cluster level 3.2 and higher includes a balloon device, unless specifically removed. Each host in this cluster receives a balloon policy update when its status changes to <code>Up</code>. It is important to understand that in some scenarios ballooning may collide with KSM. In such cases MoM will try to adjust the balloon size to minimize collisions. Additionally, in some scenarios ballooning may cause sub-optimal performance for a virtual machine.

##### Resilience Policy Settings Explained

The resilience policy sets the virtual machine migration policy in the event of host failure. Virtual machines running on a host that unexpectedly shuts down or is put into maintenance mode are migrated to other hosts in the cluster; this migration is dependent upon your cluster policy.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Virtual machine migration is a network-intensive operation. For instance, on a setup where a host is running ten or more virtual machines, migrating all of them can be a long and resource-consuming process. Therefore, select the policy action to best suit your setup. If you prefer a conservative approach, disable all migration of virtual machines. Alternatively, if you have many virtual machines, but only several which are running critical workloads, select the option to migrate only highly available virtual machines.

## Logical Networks

### Introduction to Logical Networks

A logical network is a named set of global network connectivity properties in your data center. When a logical network is added to a host, it may be further configured with host-specific network parameters. Logical networks optimize network flow by grouping network traffic by usage, type, and requirements.

Logical networks allow both connectivity and segregation. You can create a logical network for storage communication to optimize network traffic between hosts and storage domains, a logical network specifically for all virtual machine traffic, or multiple logical networks to carry the traffic of groups of virtual machines.

The default logical network in all data centers is the management network called `ovirtmgmt`. The `ovirtmgmt` network carries all traffic, until another logical network is created. It is meant especially for management communication between oVirt and hosts.

A logical network is a data center level resource; creating one in a data center makes it available to the clusters in a data center. A logical network that has been designated a **Required** must be configured in all of a cluster's hosts before it is operational. **Optional networks** can be used by any host they have been added to.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Warning:** Do not change networking in a data center or a cluster if any hosts are running as this risks making the host unreachable.

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** If you plan to use oVirt nodes to provide any services, remember that the services will stop if the oVirt environment stops operating.

This applies to all services, but you should be especially aware of the hazards of running the following on oVirt:

*   Directory Services
*   DNS
*   Storage

</div>

### Port Mirroring

Port mirroring copies layer 3 network traffic on a given logical network and host to a virtual interface on a virtual machine. This virtual machine can be used for network debugging and tuning, intrusion detection, and monitoring the behavior of other virtual machines on the same host and logical network.

The only traffic copied is internal to one logical network on one host. There is no increase on traffic on the network external to the host; however a virtual machine with port mirroring enabled uses more host CPU and RAM than other virtual machines.

Enable and disable port mirroring by editing network interfaces on virtual machines.

Port mirroring requires an IPv4 IP address.

Hotplugging profiles with port mirroring is not supported.

As of oVirt 3.4, port mirroring has been included in vNIC profiles. Port mirroring cannot be altered when the vNIC profile associated with port mirroring is attached to a virtual machine. To use port mirroring, create a dedicated vNIC profile that has port mirroring enabled.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Enabling port mirroring reduces the privacy of other network users.

</div>

### Required Networks, Optional Networks, and Virtual Machine Networks

oVirt 3.1 and higher distinguishes between required networks and optional networks.

**Required** networks must be applied to all hosts in a cluster for the cluster and network to be **Operational**. Logical networks are added to clusters as **Required** networks by default.

When a required network becomes non-operational, the virtual machines running on the network are fenced and migrated to another host. This is beneficial if you have machines running mission critical workloads.

When a non-required network becomes non-operational, the virtual machines running on the network are not migrated to another host. This prevents unnecessary I/O overload caused by mass migrations.

Optional networks are those logical networks that have not been explicitly declared **Required** networks. Optional networks can be implemented on only the hosts that use them. The presence or absence of these networks does not affect the **Operational** status of a host.

Use the **Manage Networks** button to change a network's **Required** designation.

Virtual machine networks (called a **VM network** in the user interface) are logical networks designated to carry only virtual machine network traffic. Virtual machine networks can be required or optional.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** A virtual machine with a network interface on an optional virtual machine network will not start on a host without the network.

</div>

### vNIC Profiles and QoS

#### vNIC Profile Overview

A Virtual Network Interface Card (vNIC) profile is a collection of settings that can be applied to individual virtual network interface cards in oVirt. vNIC profiles allow you to apply Network QoS profiles to a vNIC, enable or disable port mirroring, and add or remove custom properties. vNIC profiles offer an added layer of administrative flexibility in that permission to use (consume) these profiles can be granted to specific users. In this way, you can control the quality of service that different users receive from a given network.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Starting with oVirt 3.3, virtual machines now access logical networks only through vNIC profiles and cannot access a logical network if no vNIC profiles exist for that logical network. When you create a new logical network in oVirt, a vNIC profile of the same name as the logical network is automatically created under that logical network.

</div>

#### Creating a vNIC Profile

**Summary**

Create a Virtual Network Interface Controller (vNIC) profile to regulate network bandwidth for users and groups.

**Procedure 5.1. Creating a vNIC Profile**

1.  Use the **Networks** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to select a logical network in the results pane.
2.  Select the **Profiles** tab in the details pane to display available vNIC profiles. If you selected the logical network in tree mode, you can select the **vNIC Profiles** tab in the results list.
3.  Click **New** to open the **VM Interface Profile** window.
    ⁠

    ![The VM Interface Profile window|350px](VM_Interface_Profile.png "The VM Interface Profile window|350px")

    **Figure 5.1. The VM Interface Profile window**

4.  Enter the **Name** and **Description** of the profile.
5.  Use the **QoS** drop-down menu to select the relevant Quality of Service policy to apply to the vNIC profile.
6.  Use the **Port Mirroring** and **Allow all users to use this Profile** check boxes to toggle these options.
7.  Use the custom properties drop-down menu, which displays **Please select a key...** by default, to select a custom property and use the **+** and **-** buttons to add additional custom properties or remove existing custom properties.
8.  Click **OK** to save the profile and close the window.

**Result**

You have created a vNIC profile. Apply this profile to users and groups to regulate their network bandwidth.

#### Assigning Security Groups to vNIC Profiles

**Summary**

You can assign security groups to the vNIC profile of networks that have been imported from an OpenStack Networking instance and that use the Linux Bridge or Open vSwitch plug-ins. A security group is a collection of strictly enforced rules that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic over a network interface. The following procedure outlines how to attach a security group to a vNIC profile.

⁠

**Procedure 5.2. Assigning Security Groups to vNIC Profiles**

1.  Click the **Networks** tab and select a logical network in the results list.
2.  Click the **vNIC Profiles** tab in the details pane.
3.  Click **New** or select an existing vNIC profile and click **Edit** to open the **VM Interface Profile** window.
4.  From the custom properties drop-down menu, select **SecurityGroups**.
5.  In the text field to the right of the custom properties drop-down menu, enter the ID of the security group to attach to the vNIC profile.
6.  Click **OK**.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** A security group is identified using the ID of that security group as registered in the OpenStack Networking instance. You can find the IDs of security groups for a given tenant by running the following command on the system on which OpenStack Networking is installed:

    # neutron security-group-list

</div>
**Result**

You have attached a security group to the vNIC profile and all traffic through the logical network to which that profile is attached will be filtered in accordance with the rules defined for that security group.

#### Adding Multiple VLANs to a Single Network Interface Using Logical Networks

**Summary**

Multiple VLANs can be added to a single network interface to separate traffic on the one host.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** You must have created more than one logical network, all with the **Enable VLAN tagging** check box selected in the **New Logical Network** or **Edit Logical Network** windows.

</div>
**Procedure 5.10. Adding Multiple VLANs to a Network Interface using Logical Networks**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select in the results list a host associated with the cluster to which your VLAN-tagged logical networks are assigned.
2.  Click the **Network Interfaces** tab in the details pane to list the physical network interfaces attached to the data center.
3.  Click **Setup Host Networks** to open the **Setup Host Networks** window.
4.  Drag your VLAN-tagged logical networks into the **Assigned Logical Networks** area next to the physical network interface. The physical network interface can have multiple logical networks assigned due to the VLAN tagging.
    ⁠

    ![Setup Host Networks|400px](Setup_Host_Networks.png "Setup Host Networks|400px")

    **Figure 5.3. Setup Host Networks**

5.  Edit the logical networks by hovering your cursor over an assigned logical network and clicking the pencil icon to open the **Edit Network** window. If your logical network definition is not synchronized with the network configuration on the host, select the **Sync network** check box. Select a **Boot Protocol** from:
    -   **None**,
    -   **DHCP**, or
    -   **Static**, Provide the **IP** and **Subnet Mask**.

    Click **OK**.

6.  Select the **Verify connectivity between Host and Engine** check box to run a network check; this will only work if the host is in maintenance mode.
7.  Select the **Save network configuration** check box
8.  Click **OK**.

Add the logical network to each host in the cluster by editing a NIC on each host in the cluster. After this is done, the network will become operational

**Result**

You have added multiple VLAN-tagged logical networks to a single interface. This process can be repeated multiple times, selecting and editing the same network interface each time on each host to add logical networks with different VLAN tags to a single network interface.

#### Network Labels

Network labels can be used to greatly simplify several administrative tasks associated with creating and administering logical networks and associating those logical networks with physical host network interfaces and bonds.

A network label is a plain text, human readable label that can be attached to a logical network or a physical host network interface. There is no strict limit on the length of label, but you must use a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, underscores and hyphens; no spaces or special characters are allowed.

Attaching a label to a logical network or physical host network interface creates an association with other logical networks or physical host network interfaces to which the same label has been attached, as follows:

**Network Label Associations**

*   When you attach a label to a logical network, that logical network will be automatically associated with any physical host network interfaces with the given label.
*   When you attach a label to a physical host network interface, any logical networks with the given label will be automatically associated with that physical host network interface.
*   Changing the label attached to a logical network or physical host network interface acts in the same way as removing a label and adding a new label. The association between related logical networks or physical host network interfaces is updated.

**Network Labels and Clusters**

*   When a labeled logical network is added to a cluster and there is a physical host network interface in that cluster with the same label, the logical network is automatically added to that physical host network interface.
*   When a labeled logical network is detached from a cluster and there is a physical host network interface in that cluster with the same label, the logical network is automatically detached from that physical host network interface.

**Network Labels and Logical Networks With Roles**

*   When a labeled logical network is assigned to act as a display network or migration network, that logical network is then configured on the physical host network interface using DHCP so that the logical network can be assigned an IP address.

##### Adding Network Labels to Host Network Interfaces

**Summary**

Using network labels allows you to greatly simplify the administrative workload associated with assigning logical networks to host network interfaces.

**Procedure 5.11. Adding Network Labels to Host Network Interfaces**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select in the results list a host associated with the cluster to which your VLAN-tagged logical networks are assigned.
2.  Click the **Network Interfaces** tab in the details pane to list the physical network interfaces attached to the data center.
3.  Click **Setup Host Networks** to open the **Setup Host Networks** window.
4.  Edit a physical network interface by hovering your cursor over a physical network interface and clicking the pencil icon to open the **Edit Interface** window.
    ⁠

    ![The Edit Interface Window|200px](Edit_Management_Network.png "The Edit Interface Window|200px")

    **Figure 5.4. The Edit Interface Window**

5.  Enter a name for the network label in the **Label** text field and use the **+** and **-** buttons to add or remove additional network labels.
6.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have added a network label to a host network interface. Any newly created logical networks with the same label will be automatically assigned to all host network interfaces with that label. Also, removing a label from a logical network will automatically remove that logical network from all host network interfaces with that label.

#### Using the Networks Tab

The **Networks** resource tab provides a central location for users to perform network-related operations and search for networks based on each network's property or association with other resources.

All networks in the oVirt environment display in the results list of the **Networks** tab. The **New**, **Edit** and **Remove** buttons allow you to create, change the properties of, and delete logical networks within data centers.

Click on each network name and use the **Clusters**, **Hosts**, **Virtual Machines**, **Templates**, and **Permissions** tabs in the details pane to perform functions including:

*   Attaching or detaching the networks to clusters and hosts
*   Removing network interfaces from virtual machines and templates
*   Adding and removing permissions for users to access and manage networks

These functions are also accessible through each individual resource tab.

### External Provider Networks

#### Importing Networks From External Providers

**Summary**

If an external provider offering networking services has been registered in oVirt, the networks provided by that provider can be imported into oVirt and used by virtual machines.

**Procedure 5.12. Importing a Network From an External Provider**

1.  Click the **Networks** tab.
2.  Click the **Import** button to open the **Import Networks** window.
    ⁠

    ![The Import Networks Window|300px](Import_Networks.png "The Import Networks Window|300px")

    **Figure 5.5. The Import Networks Window**

3.  From the **Network Provider** drop-down list, select an external provider. The networks offered by that provider are automatically discovered and listed in the **Provider Networks** list.
4.  Using the check boxes, select the networks to import in the **Provider Networks** list and click the down arrow to move those networks into the **Networks to Import** list.
5.  From the **Data Center** drop-down list, select the data center into which the networks will be imported.
6.  Optionally, clear the **Allow All** check box for a network in the **Networks to Import** list to prevent that network from being available to all users.
7.  Click the **Import** button.

**Result**

The selected networks are imported into the target data center and can now be used in oVirt.

#### Limitations to Using External Provider Networks

The following limitations apply to using logical networks imported from an external provider in an oVirt environment.

*   Logical networks offered by external providers must be used as virtual machine networks, and cannot be used as display networks.
*   The same logical network can be imported more than once, but only to different data centers.
*   You cannot edit logical networks offered by external providers in oVirt. To edit the details of a logical network offered by an external provider, you must edit the logical network directly from the OpenStack Networking instance that provides that logical network.
*   Port mirroring is not available for virtual network interface cards connected to logical networks offered by external providers.
*   If a virtual machine uses a logical network offered by an external provider, that provider cannot be deleted from oVirt while the logical network is still in use by the virtual machine.
*   Networks offered by external providers are non-required. As such, scheduling for clusters in which such logical networks have been imported will not take those logical networks into account during host selection. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure the availability of the logical network on hosts in clusters in which such logical networks have been imported.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Logical networks imported from external providers are only compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts and cannot be assigned to virtual machines running on oVirt Node hosts.

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** External provider discovery and importing are Technology Preview features. Technology Preview features are not fully supported under Red Hat Subscription Service Level Agreements (SLAs), may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. However, these features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

</div>

#### Subnets on External Provider Logical Networks

##### Configuring Subnets on External Provider Logical Networks

A logical network provided by an external provider can only assign IP addresses to virtual machines if one or more subnets have been defined on that logical network. If no subnets are defined, virtual machines will not be assigned IP addresses. If there is one subnet, virtual machines will be assigned an IP address from that subnet, and if there are multiple subnets, virtual machines will be assigned an IP address from any of the available subnets. The DHCP service provided by the Neutron instance on which the logical network is hosted is responsible for assigning these IP addresses.

While oVirt automatically discovers predefined subnets on imported logical networks, you can also add or remove subnets to or from logical networks from within oVirt.

##### Adding Subnets to External Provider Logical Networks

**Summary**

Create a subnet on a logical network provided by an external provider

⁠

**Procedure 5.13. Adding Subnets to External Provider Logical Networks**

1.  Click the **Networks** tab.
2.  Click the logical network provided by an external provider to which the subnet will be added.
3.  Click the **Subnets** tab in the details pane.
4.  Click the **New** button to open the **New External Subnet** window.
5.  Enter a **Name** and **CIDR** for the new subnet.

**Result**

The subnet is removed from the logical network.

## ⁠Hosts

### Introduction to oVirt Hosts

Hosts, also known as hypervisors, are the physical servers on which virtual machines run. Full virtualization is provided by using a loadable Linux kernel module called Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).

KVM can concurrently host multiple virtual machines running either Windows or Linux operating systems. Virtual machines run as individual Linux processes and threads on the host machine and are managed remotely by oVirt. An oVirt environment has one or more hosts attached to it.

oVirt supports two methods of installing hosts. You can use the oVirt Node installation media, or install hypervisor packages on a standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora installation.

oVirt hosts take advantage of **tuned** profiles, which provide virtualization optimizations. For more information on **tuned** for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please refer to the *[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 Performance Tuning Guide](//access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html-single/Performance_Tuning_Guide/index.html)*.

The oVirt Node has security features enabled. Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) and the iptables firewall are fully configured and on by default. oVirt can open required ports on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora hosts when it adds them to the environment. For a full list of ports, see [Section A.2, “Virtualization Host Firewall Requirements”](#Virtualization_Host_Firewall_Requirements1).

A host is a physical 64-bit server with the Intel VT or AMD-V extensions running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 or later, as well as CentOS 6.1 or later, in either the AMD64/Intel 64 version.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 machines that belong to existing clusters are supported. oVirt Guest Agent is now included in the `virtio serial` channel. Any Guest Agents installed on Windows guests on Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts will lose their connection to oVirt when the Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts are upgraded from version 5 to version 6.

</div>
A physical host on the oVirt platform:

*   Must belong to only one cluster in the system.
*   Must have CPUs that support the AMD-V or Intel VT hardware virtualization extensions.
*   Must have CPUs that support all functionality exposed by the virtual CPU type selected upon cluster creation.
*   Has a minimum of 2 GB RAM.
*   Can have an assigned system administrator with system permissions.

### oVirt Node Hosts

oVirt Node hosts are installed using a special build of Fedora, with only the packages required to host virtual machines. They run stateless, not writing any changes to disk unless explicitly required to.

oVirt Node hosts can be added directly to, and configured by, oVirt. Alternatively a host can be configured locally to connect to oVirt; oVirt then is only used to approve the host to be used in the environment.

Unlike Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, or CentOS hosts, oVirt Node hosts cannot be added to clusters that have been enabled for Gluster service for use as Red Hat Storage nodes.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** The oVirt Node is a closed system. Use a Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora host if additional rpm packages are required for your environment.

</div>

### Foreman Host Provider Hosts

Hosts provided by a Foreman host provider can also be used as virtualization hosts by oVirt. After a Foreman host provider has been added to oVirt as an external provider, any hosts that it provides can be added to and used in oVirt in the same way as oVirt Node hosts and Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS hosts.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Foreman host provider hosts are a Technology Preview feature. Technology Preview features are not fully supported, may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. However, these features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

</div>

### Enterprise Linux Hosts

You can use a standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or CentOS 6 installation on capable hardware as a host. oVirt supports hosts running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or CentOS server AMD64/Intel 64 version.

Adding a host can take some time, as the following steps are completed by the platform: virtualization checks, installation of packages, creation of bridge and a reboot of the host. Use the Details pane to monitor the hand-shake process as the host and management system establish a connection.

### Host Tasks

#### Adding an Enterprise Linux Host

**Summary**

An Enterprise Linux host is based on a standard "basic" installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS. The physical host must be set up before you can add it to the oVirt environment.

oVirt logs into the host to perform virtualization capability checks, install packages, create a network bridge, and reboot the host. The process of adding a new host can take up to 10 minutes.

**Procedure 6.1. Adding an Enterprise Linux Host**

1.  Click the **Hosts** resource tab to list the hosts in the results list.
2.  Click **New** to open the **New Host** window.
3.  Use the drop-down menus to select the **Data Center** and **Host Cluster** for the new host.
4.  Enter the **Name**, **Address**, and **SSH Port** of the new host.
5.  Select an authentication method to use with the host.
    -   Enter the root user's password to use password authentication.
    -   Copy the key displayed in the **SSH PublicKey** field to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the host to use public key authentication.

6.  You have now completed the mandatory steps to add a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS host. Click the **Advanced Parameters** button to expand the advanced host settings.
    1.  Optionally disable automatic firewall configuration.
    2.  Optionally add a host SSH fingerprint to increase security. You can add it manually, or fetch it automatically.

7.  You can configure the **Power Management** and **SPM** using the applicable tabs now; however, as these are not fundamental to adding a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host, they are not covered in this procedure.
8.  Click **OK** to add the host and close the window.

**Result**

The new host displays in the list of hosts with a status of `Installing`. When installation is complete, the status updates to `Reboot`. The host must be activated for the status to change to `Up`.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can view the progress of the installation in the details pane.

</div>

#### Approving a Hypervisor

**Summary**

It is not possible to run virtual machines on a Hypervisor until the addition of it to the environment has been approved in oVirt.

**Procedure 6.2. Approving a Hypervisor**

1.  Log in to oVirt Administration Portal.
2.  From the **Hosts** tab, click on the host to be approved. The host should currently be listed with the status of **Pending Approval**.
3.  Click the **Approve** button. The **Edit and Approve Hosts** dialog displays. You can use the dialog to set a name for the host, fetch its SSH fingerprint before approving it, and configure power management, where the host has a supported power management card. For information on power management configuration, refer to [“Host Power Management Settings Explained”](#Host_Power_Management_Settings_Explained).
4.  Click **OK**. If you have not configured power management you will be prompted to confirm that you wish to proceed without doing so, click **OK**.

**Result**

The status in the **Hosts** tab changes to **Installing**, after a brief delay the host status changes to **Up**.

#### Configuring Host Power Management Settings

**Summary**

Configure your host power management device settings to perform host life-cycle operations (stop, start, restart) from the Administration Portal.

It is necessary to configure host power management in order to utilize host high availability and virtual machine high availability.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Ensure that your host is in `maintenance mode` before configuring power management settings. Otherwise, all running virtual machines on that host will be stopped ungracefully upon restarting the host, which can cause disruptions in production environments. A warning dialog will appear if you have not correctly set your host to `maintenance mode.`

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 6.3. Configuring Power Management Settings**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the host in the results list.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Host** window.
3.  Click the **Power Management** tab to display the Power Management settings.
4.  Select the **Enable Power Management** check box to enable the fields.
5.  The **Primary** option is selected by default if you are configuring a new power management device. If you are adding a new device, set it to **Secondary**.
6.  Select the **Concurrent** check box to enable multiple fence agents to be used concurrently.
7.  Enter the **Address**, **User Name**, and **Password** of the power management device into the appropriate fields.
8.  Use the drop-down menu to select the **Type** of power management device.
9.  Enter the **Port** number used by the power management device to communicate with the host.
10. Enter the **Options** for the power management device. Use a comma-separated list of **key=value** or **key**.
11. Select the **Secure** check box to enable the power management device to connect securely to the host.
12. Click **Test** to ensure the settings are correct.
13. Click **OK** to save your settings and close the window.

**Result**

You have configured the power management settings for the host. The **Power Management** drop-down menu is now enabled in the Administration Portal.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Power management is controlled by the **Cluster Policy** of the host's **cluster**. If power management is enabled and the defined low utilization value is reached, oVirt will power down the host machine, and restart it again when load balancing requires or there are not enough free hosts in the cluster. Tick the **Disable policy control of power management** check box if you do not wish for your host to automatically perform these functions.

</div>

#### Configuring Host Storage Pool Manager Settings

**Summary**

The Storage Pool Manager (SPM) is a management role given to one of the hosts in a data center to maintain access control over the storage domains. The SPM must always be available, and the SPM role will be assigned to another host if the SPM host becomes unavailable. As the SPM role uses some of the host's available resources, it is important to prioritize hosts that can afford the resources.

The Storage Pool Manager (SPM) priority setting of a host alters the likelihood of the host being assigned the SPM role: a host with high SPM priority will be assigned the SPM role before a host with low SPM priority.

⁠

**Procedure 6.4. Configuring SPM settings**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the host in the results list.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Host** window.
3.  Click the **SPM** tab to display the **SPM Priority** settings.
4.  Use the radio buttons to select the appropriate SPM priority for the host.
5.  Click **OK** to save the settings and close the window.

**Result**

You have configured the SPM priority of the host.

#### Editing a Resource

**Summary**

Edit the properties of a resource.

⁠

**Procedure 6.5. Editing a Resource**

1.  Use the resource tabs, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the resource in the results list.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit** window.
3.  Change the necessary properties and click **OK**.

**Result**

The new properties are saved to the resource. The **Edit** window will not close if a property field is invalid.

#### Approving Newly Added oVirt Node Hosts

**Summary**

You have to install your oVirt Node hosts before you can approve them in oVirt. Read about installing oVirt Nodes in the *oVirt Installation Guide*.

Once installed, the oVirt Node host is visible in the Administration Portal but not active. Approve it so that it can host virtual machines.

**Procedure 6.6. Approving newly added oVirt Node hosts**

1.  In the **Hosts** tab, select the host you recently installed using the oVirt Node host installation media. This host shows a status of `Pending Approval`.
2.  Click the **Approve** button.

**Result**

The host's status changes to `Up` and it can be used to run virtual machines.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can also add this host using the procedure in [“Adding an Enterprise Linux Host”](#Adding_an_Enterprise_Linux_Host), which utilizes the oVirt Node host's IP address and the password that was set on the **oVirt Engine** screen.

</div>

#### Moving a Host to Maintenance Mode

**Summary**

Many common maintenance tasks, including network configuration and deployment of software updates, require that hosts be placed into maintenance mode. When a host is placed into maintenance mode oVirt attempts to migrate all running virtual machines to alternative hosts.

The normal prerequisites for live migration apply, in particular there must be at least one active host in the cluster with capacity to run the migrated virtual machines.

#### Bonds

##### Bonding Logic in oVirt

oVirt Administration Portal allows you to create bond devices using a graphical interface. There are several distinct bond creation scenarios, each with its own logic.

Two factors that affect bonding logic are:

*   Are either of the devices already carrying logical networks?
*   Are the devices carrying compatible logical networks? A single device cannot carry both VLAN tagged and non-VLAN tagged logical networks.

⁠

If the bond devices carry incompatible logical networks, the bonding operation fails until you detach incompatible logical networks from the devices forming your new bond.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

##### Bonding Modes

oVirt supports the following common bonding modes:

*   Mode 1 (active-backup policy) sets all interfaces to the backup state while one remains active. Upon failure on the active interface, a backup interface replaces it as the only active interface in the bond. The MAC address of the bond in mode 1 is visible on only one port (the network adapter), to prevent confusion for the switch. Mode 1 provides fault tolerance and is supported in oVirt.
*   Mode 2 (XOR policy) selects an interface to transmit packages to based on the result of an XOR operation on the source and destination MAC addresses modulo NIC slave count. This calculation ensures that the same interface is selected for each destination MAC address used. Mode 2 provides fault tolerance and load balancing and is supported in oVirt.
*   Mode 4 (IEEE 802.3ad policy) creates aggregation groups for which included interfaces share the speed and duplex settings. Mode 4 uses all interfaces in the active aggregation group in accordance with the IEEE 802.3ad specification and is supported in oVirt.
*   Mode 5 (adaptive transmit load balancing policy) ensures the outgoing traffic distribution is according to the load on each interface and that the current interface receives all incoming traffic. If the interface assigned to receive traffic fails, another interface is assigned the receiving role instead. Mode 5 is supported in oVirt.

##### Creating a Bond Device Using the Administration Portal

**Summary**

You can bond compatible network devices together. This type of configuration can increase available bandwidth and reliability. You can bond multiple network interfaces, pre-existing bond devices, and combinations of the two.

A bond cannot carry both vlan tagged and non-vlan traffic.

⁠

**Procedure 6.13. Creating a Bond Device using the Administration Portal**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the host in the results list.
2.  Click the **Network Interfaces** tab in the details pane to list the physical network interfaces attached to the host.
3.  Click **Setup Host Networks** to open the **Setup Host Networks** window.
4.  Select and drag one of the devices over the top of another device and drop it to open the **Create New Bond** window. Alternatively, right-click the device and select another device from the drop-down menu.
    If the devices are incompatible, for example one is vlan tagged and the other is not, the bond operation fails with a suggestion on how to correct the compatibility issue.

    ⁠

    ![Bond Devices Window](Create_New_Bond.png "Bond Devices Window")

    **Figure 6.3. Bond Devices Window**

5.  Select the **Bond Name** and **Bonding Mode** from the drop-down menus. Bonding modes 1, 2, 4, and 5 can be selected. Any other mode can be configured using the **Custom** option.
6.  Click **OK** to create the bond and close the **Create New Bond** window.
7.  Assign a logical network to the newly created bond device.
8.  Optionally choose to **Verify connectivity between Host and Engine** and **Save network configuration**.
9.  Click **OK** accept the changes and close the **Setup Host Networks** window.

**Result**

Your network devices are linked into a bond device and can be edited as a single interface. The bond device is listed in the **Network Interfaces** tab of the details pane for the selected host.

Bonding must be enabled for the ports of the switch used by the host. The process by which bonding is enabled is slightly different for each switch; consult the manual provided by your switch vendor for detailed information on how to enable bonding.

##### Example Uses of Custom Bonding Options with Host Interfaces

You can create customized bond devices by selecting **Custom** from the **Bonding Mode** of the **Create New Bond** window. The following examples should be adapted for your needs. For a comprehensive list of bonding options and their descriptions, see the [*Linux Ethernet Bonding Driver HOWTO*](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt) on Kernel.org.

⁠

**Example 6.1. xmit_hash_policy**

This option defines the transmit load balancing policy for bonding modes 2 and 4. For example, if the majority of your traffic is between many different IP addresses, you may want to set a policy to balance by IP address. You can set this load-balancing policy by selecting a **Custom** bonding mode, and entering the following into the text field:

    mode=4 xmit_hash_policy=layer2+3

⁠

**Example 6.2. ARP Monitoring**

ARP monitor is useful for systems which can't or don't report link-state properly via ethtool. Set an *`arp_interval`* on the bond device of the host by selecting a **Custom** bonding mode, and entering the following into the text field:

    mode=1 arp_interval=1 arp_ip_target=192.168.0.2

⁠

**Example 6.3. Primary**

You may want to designate a NIC with higher throughput as the primary interface in a bond device. Designate which NIC is primary by selecting a **Custom** bonding mode, and entering the following into the text field:

    mode=1 primary=eth0

#### Saving a Host Network Configuration

**Summary**

One of the options when configuring a host network is to save the configuration as you apply it, making the changes persistent.

Any changes made to the host network configuration will be temporary if you did not select the **Save network configuration** check box in the **Setup Host Networks** window.

Save the host network configuration to make it persistent.

⁠

**Procedure 6.14. Saving a host network configuration**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the host in the results list.
2.  Click the **Network Interfaces** tab on the Details pane to list the NICs on the host, their address, and other specifications.
3.  Click the **Save Network Configuration** button.
4.  The host network configuration is saved and the following message is displayed on the task bar: "Network changes were saved on host *[Hostname]*."

**Result**

The host's network configuration is saved persistently and will survive reboots.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Saving the host network configuration also updates the list of available network interfaces for the host. This behavior is similar to that of the **Refresh Capabilities** button.

</div>

### Host Resilience

#### Host High Availability

oVirt uses fencing to keep the hosts in a cluster responsive. A **Non Responsive** host is different from a **Non Operational** host. **Non Operational** hosts can be communicated with by oVirt, but have an incorrect configuration, for example a missing logical network. **Non Responsive** hosts cannot be communicated with by oVirt.

If a host with a power management device loses communication with oVirt, it can be fenced (rebooted) from the Administration Portal. All the virtual machines running on that host are stopped, and highly available virtual machines are started on a different host.

All power management operations are done using a proxy host, as opposed to directly by oVirt. At least two hosts are required for power management operations.

Fencing allows a cluster to react to unexpected host failures as well as enforce power saving, load balancing, and virtual machine availability policies. You should configure the fencing parameters for your host's power management device and test their correctness from time to time.

Hosts can be fenced automatically using the power management parameters, or manually by right-clicking on a host and using the options on the menu. In a fencing operation, an unresponsive host is rebooted, and if the host does not return to an active status within a prescribed time, it remains unresponsive pending manual intervention and troubleshooting.

If the host is required to run virtual machines that are highly available, power management must be enabled and configured.

#### Power Management by Proxy in oVirt

oVirt does not communicate directly with fence agents. Instead, oVirt uses a proxy to send power management commands to a host power management device. oVirt uses VDSM to execute power management device actions, so another host in the environment is used as a fencing proxy.

You can select between:

*   Any host in the same cluster as the host requiring fencing.
*   Any host in the same data center as the host requiring fencing.

A viable fencing proxy host has a status of either *UP* or *Maintenance*.

#### Setting Fencing Parameters on a Host

The parameters for host fencing are set using the **Power Management** fields on the **New Host** or **Edit Host** windows. Power management enables the system to fence a troublesome host using an additional interface such as a Remote Access Card (RAC).

All power management operations are done using a proxy host, as opposed to directly by oVirt. At least two hosts are required for power management operations.

⁠

**Procedure 6.15. Setting fencing parameters on a host**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the host in the results list.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Host** window.
3.  Click the **Power Management** tab.
    ⁠

    ![Power Management Settings](Edit Host Power Management.png "Power Management Settings")

    **Figure 6.4. Power Management Settings**

4.  Select the **Enable Power Management** check box to enable the fields.
5.  The **Primary** option is selected by default if you are configuring a new power management device. If you are adding a new device, set it to **Secondary**.
6.  Select the **Concurrent** check box to enable multiple fence agents to be used concurrently.
7.  Enter the **Address**, **User Name**, and **Password** of the power management device.
8.  Select the power management device **Type** from the drop-down menu.
9.  Enter the **Port** number used by the power management device to communicate with the host.
10. Enter the specific **Options** of the power management device. Use a comma-separated list of 'key=value' or 'key' entries.
11. Click the **Test** button to test the power management device. *Test Succeeded, Host Status is: on* will display upon successful verification.
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Warning:** Power management parameters (userid, password, options, etc) are tested by oVirt only during setup and manually after that. If you choose to ignore alerts about incorrect parameters, or if the parameters are changed on the power management hardware without the corresponding change in oVirt, fencing is likely to fail when most needed.

    </div>
12. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the window.

**Result**

You are returned to the list of hosts. Note that the exclamation mark next to the host's name has now disappeared, signifying that power management has been successfully configured.

#### Soft-Fencing Hosts

Sometimes a host becomes non-responsive due to an unexpected problem, and though VDSM is unable to respond to requests, the virtual machines that depend upon VDSM remain alive and accessible. In these situations, restarting VDSM returns VDSM to a responsive state and resolves this issue.

oVirt 3.3 introduces "soft-fencing over SSH". Prior to oVirt 3.3, non-responsive hosts were fenced only by external fencing devices. In oVirt 3.3, the fencing process has been expanded to include "SSH Soft Fencing", a process whereby oVirt attempts to restart VDSM via SSH on non-responsive hosts. If oVirt fails to restart VDSM via SSH, the responsibility for fencing falls to the external fencing agent if an external fencing agent has been configured.

Soft-fencing over SSH works as follows. Fencing must be configured and enabled on the host, and a valid proxy host (a second host, in an UP state, in the data center) must exist. When the connection between oVirt and the host times out, the following happens:

1.  On the first network failure, the status of the host changes to "connecting".
2.  oVirt then makes three attempts to ask VDSM for its status, or it waits for an interval determined by the load on the host. The formula for determining the length of the interval is configured by the configuration values TimeoutToResetVdsInSeconds (the default is 60 seconds) + [DelayResetPerVmInSeconds (the default is 0.5 seconds)]\*(the count of running vms on host) + [DelayResetForSpmInSeconds (the default is 20 seconds)] \* 1 (if host runs as SPM) or 0 (if the host does not run as SPM). To give VDSM the maximum amount of time to respond, oVirt chooses the longer of the two options mentioned above (three attempts to retrieve the status of VDSM or the interval determined by the above formula).
3.  If the host does not respond when that interval has elapsed, `vdsm restart` is executed via SSH.
4.  If `vdsm restart` does not succeed in re-establishing the connection between the host and oVirt, the status of the host changes to `Non Responsive` and, if power management is configured, fencing is handed off to the external fencing agent.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Soft-fencing over SSH can be executed on hosts that have no power management configured. This is distinct from "fencing": fencing can be executed only on hosts that have power management configured.

</div>

#### Using Host Power Management Functions

**Summary**

When power management has been configured for a host, you can access a number of options from the Administration Portal interface. While each power management device has its own customizable options, they all support the basic options to start, stop, and restart a host.

⁠

**Procedure 6.16. Using Host Power Management Functions**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the host in the results list.
2.  Click the **Power Management** drop-down menu.
3.  Select one of the following options:

    *   **Restart**: This option stops the host and waits until the host's status changes to `Down`. When the agent has verified that the host is down, the highly available virtual machines are restarted on another host in the cluster. The agent then restarts this host. When the host is ready for use its status displays as `Up`.
    *   **Start**: This option starts the host and lets it join a cluster. When it is ready for use its status displays as `Up`.
    *   **Stop**: This option powers off the host. Before using this option, ensure that the virtual machines running on the host have been migrated to other hosts in the cluster. Otherwise the virtual machines will crash and only the highly available virtual machines will be restarted on another host. When the host has been stopped its status displays as `Non-Operational`.

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Important:** When two fencing agents are defined on a host, they can be used concurrently or sequentially. For concurrent agents, both agents have to respond to the Stop command for the host to be stopped; and when one agent responds to the Start command, the host will go up. For sequential agents, to start or stop a host, the primary agent is used first; if it fails, the secondary agent is used.

    </div>

4.  Selecting one of the above options opens a confirmation window. Click **OK** to confirm and proceed.

**Result**

The selected action is performed.

#### Manually Fencing or Isolating a Non Responsive Host

**Summary**

If a host unpredictably goes into a non-responsive state, for example, due to a hardware failure; it can significantly affect the performance of the environment. If you do not have a power management device, or it is incorrectly configured, you can reboot the host manually.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Warning:** Do not use the **Confirm host has been rebooted** option unless you have manually rebooted the host. Using this option while the host is still running can lead to a virtual machine image corruption.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 6.17. Manually fencing or isolating a non-responsive host**

1.  On the **Hosts** tab, select the host. The status must display as `non-responsive`.
2.  Manually reboot the host. This could mean physically entering the lab and rebooting the host.
3.  On the Administration Portal, right-click the host entry and select the **Confirm Host has been rebooted** button.
4.  A message displays prompting you to ensure that the host has been shut down or rebooted. Select the **Approve Operation** check box and click **OK**.

**Result**

You have manually rebooted your host, allowing highly available virtual machines to be started on active hosts. You confirmed your manual fencing action in the Administrator Portal, and the host is back online.

## ⁠Storage

oVirt uses a centralized storage system for virtual machine disk images, ISO files and snapshots. Storage networking can be implemented using:

*   Network File System (NFS)
*   GlusterFS exports
*   Other POSIX compliant file systems
*   Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)
*   Local storage attached directly to the virtualization hosts
*   Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP)
*   Parallel NFS (pNFS)

Setting up storage is a prerequisite for a new data center because a data center cannot be initialized unless storage domains are attached and activated.

As an oVirt system administrator, you need to create, configure, attach and maintain storage for the virtualized enterprise. You should be familiar with the storage types and their use. Read your storage array vendor's guides, and refer to the *Red Hat Enterprise Linux Storage Administration Guide* for more information on the concepts, protocols, requirements or general usage of storage.

The oVirt platform enables you to assign and manage storage using the Administration Portal's **Storage** tab. The **Storage** results list displays all the storage domains, and the details pane shows general information about the domain.

oVirt platform has three types of storage domains:

*   **Data Domain:** A data domain holds the virtual hard disks and OVF files of all the virtual machines and templates in a data center. In addition, snapshots of the virtual machines are also stored in the data domain. The data domain cannot be shared across data centers. Storage domains of multiple types (iSCSI, NFS, FC, POSIX, and Gluster) can be added to the same data center, provided they are all shared, rather than local, domains. You must attach a data domain to a data center before you can attach domains of other types to it.
*   **ISO Domain:** ISO domains store ISO files (or logical CDs) used to install and boot operating systems and applications for the virtual machines. An ISO domain removes the data center's need for physical media. An ISO domain can be shared across different data centers.
*   **Export Domain:** Export domains are temporary storage repositories that are used to copy and move images between data centers and oVirt environments. Export domains can be used to backup virtual machines. An export domain can be moved between data centers, however, it can only be active in one data center at a time.
    **Important**

    Support for export storage domains backed by storage on anything other than NFS is being deprecated. While existing export storage domains imported from oVirt 2.2 environments remain supported new export storage domains must be created on NFS storage.

Only commence configuring and attaching storage for your oVirt environment once you have determined the storage needs of your data center(s).

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** To add storage domains you must be able to successfully access the Administration Portal, and there must be at least one host connected with a status of **Up**.

</div>

### Understanding Storage Domains

A storage domain is a collection of images that have a common storage interface. A storage domain contains complete images of templates and virtual machines (including snapshots), or ISO files. A storage domain can be made of either block devices (SAN - iSCSI or FCP) or a file system (NAS - NFS, GlusterFS, or other POSIX compliant file systems).

On NFS, all virtual disks, templates, and snapshots are files.

On SAN (iSCSI/FCP), each virtual disk, template or snapshot is a logical volume. Block devices are aggregated into a logical entity called a volume group, and then divided by LVM (Logical Volume Manager) into logical volumes for use as virtual hard disks.

Virtual disks can have one of two formats, either Qcow2 or RAW. The type of storage can be either Sparse or Preallocated. Snapshots are always sparse but can be taken for disks created either as RAW or sparse.

Virtual machines that share the same storage domain can be migrated between hosts that belong to the same cluster.

### Storage Metadata Versions in oVirt

oVirt stores information about storage domains as metadata on the storage domains themselves. Each major release of oVirt has seen improved implementations of storage metadata.

*   *V1 metadata (oVirt 2.x series)* Each storage domain contains metadata describing its own structure, and all of the names of physical volumes that are used to back virtual machine disk images. Master domains additionally contain metadata for all the domains and physical volume names in the storage pool. The total size of this metadata is limited to 2 kb, limiting the number of storage domains that can be in a pool. Template and virtual machine base images are read only. V1 metadata is applicable to NFS, iSCSI, and FC storage domains.
*   *V2 metadata (oVirt 3.0)* All storage domain and pool metadata is stored as logical volume tags rather than written to a logical volume. Metadata about virtual machine disk volumes is still stored in a logical volume on the domains. Physical volume names are no longer included in the metadata. Template and virtual machine base images are read only. V2 metadata is applicable to iSCSI, and FC storage domains.
*   *V3 metadata (oVirt 3.1+)* All storage domain and pool metadata is stored as logical volume tags rather than written to a logical volume. Metadata about virtual machine disk volumes is still stored in a logical volume on the domains. Virtual machine and template base images are no longer read only. This change enables live snapshots, live storage migration, and clone from snapshot. Support for unicode metadata is added, for non-English volume names. V3 metadata is applicable to NFS, GlusterFS, POSIX, iSCSI, and FC storage domains.

### Preparing and Adding File-Based Storage

#### Preparing NFS Storage

**Summary**

These steps must be taken to prepare an NFS file share on a server running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 for use with oVirt.

⁠

**Procedure 7.1. Preparing NFS Storage**

1.  **Install nfs-utils**
    NFS functionality is provided by the nfs-utils package. Before file shares can be created, check that the package is installed by querying the RPM database for the system:

        $ rpm -qi nfs-utils

    If the nfs-utils package is installed then the package information will be displayed. If no output is displayed then the package is not currently installed. Install it using `yum` while logged in as the `root` user:

        # yum install nfs-utils

2.  **Configure Boot Scripts**
    To ensure that NFS shares are always available when the system is operational both the `nfs` and `rpcbind` services must start at boot time. Use the `chkconfig` command while logged in as `root` to modify the boot scripts.

        # chkconfig --add rpcbind
        # chkconfig --add nfs
        # chkconfig rpcbind on
        # chkconfig nfs on

    Once the boot script configuration has been done, start the services for the first time.

        # service rpcbind start
        # service nfs start

3.  **Create Directory**
    Create the directory you wish to share using NFS.

        # mkdir /exports/iso

    Replace */exports/iso* with the name, and path of the directory you wish to use.

4.  **Export Directory**
    To be accessible over the network using NFS the directory must be exported. NFS exports are controlled using the `/etc/exports` configuration file. Each export path appears on a separate line followed by a tab character and any additional NFS options. Exports to be attached to oVirt must have the read, and write, options set.

    To grant read, and write access to `/exports/iso` using NFS for example you add the following line to the `/etc/exports` file.

        /exports/iso       *(rw)

    Again, replace */exports/iso* with the name, and path of the directory you wish to use.

5.  **Reload NFS Configuration**
    For the changes to the `/etc/exports` file to take effect the service must be told to reload the configuration. To force the service to reload the configuration run the following command as `root`:

        # service nfs reload

6.  **Set Permissions**
    The NFS export directory must be configured for read write access and must be owned by vdsm:kvm. If these users do not exist on your external NFS server use the following command, assuming that `/exports/iso` is the directory to be used as an NFS share.

        # chown -R 36:36 /exports/iso

    The permissions on the directory must be set to allow read and write access to the owner, and read and execute access to the group and other users. The owner will also have execute access to the directory. The permissions are set using the `chmod` command. The following command arguments set the required permissions on the `/exports/iso` directory.

        # chmod 0755 /exports/iso

**Result**

The NFS file share has been created, and is ready to be attached by oVirt.

#### Attaching NFS Storage

**Summary**

An NFS type **Storage Domain** is a mounted NFS share that is attached to a data center. It is used to provide storage for virtualized guest images and ISO boot media. Once NFS storage has been exported it must be attached to oVirt using the Administration Portal.

NFS data domains can be added to NFS data centers. You can add NFS, ISO, and export storage domains to data centers of any type.

**Procedure 7.2. Attaching NFS Storage**

1.  Click the **Storage** resource tab to list the existing storage domains.
2.  Click **New Domain** to open the **New Domain** window.
    ⁠

    ![NFS Storage](New Domain.png "NFS Storage")

    **Figure 7.1. NFS Storage**

3.  Enter the **Name** of the storage domain.
4.  Select the **Data Center**, **Domain Function / Storage Type**, and **Use Host** from the drop-down menus. If applicable, select the **Format** from the drop-down menu.
5.  Enter the **Export Path** to be used for the storage domain. The export path should be in the format of `192.168.0.10:/data or domain.example.com:/data`
6.  Click **Advanced Parameters** to enable further configurable settings. It is recommended that the values of these parameters not be modified.
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Important:** All communication to the storage domain is from the selected host and not directly from oVirt. At least one active host must be attached to the chosen Data Center before the storage is configured.

    </div>
7.  Click **OK** to create the storage domain and close the window.

**Result**

The new NFS data domain is displayed on the **Storage** tab with a status of `Locked` while the disk prepares. It is automatically attached to the data center upon completion.

#### Preparing Local Storage

**Summary**

A local storage domain can be set up on a host. When you set up host to use local storage, the host automatically gets added to a new data center and cluster that no other hosts can be added to. Multiple host clusters require that all hosts have access to all storage domains, which is not possible with local storage. Virtual machines created in a single host cluster cannot be migrated, fenced or scheduled.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** On the "oVirt Node" system the only path permitted for use as local storage is `/data/images`. This directory already exists with the correct permissions on Hypervisor installations. The steps in this procedure are only required when preparing local storage on an oVirt hypervisor installed on a stock OS, such as Fedora or Centos.
</div>
⁠

**Procedure 7.3. Preparing Local Storage**

1.  On the virtualization host, create the directory to be used for the local storage.
        # mkdir -p /data/images

2.  Ensure that the directory has permissions allowing read/write access to the `vdsm` user (UID 36) and `kvm` group (GID 36).
        # chown 36:36 /data /data/images

        # chmod 0755 /data /data/images

**Result**

Your local storage is ready to be added to the oVirt environment.

#### Adding Local Storage

**Summary**

Storage local to your host has been prepared. Now use oVirt to add it to the host.

Adding local storage to a host in this manner causes the host to be put in a new data center and cluster. The local storage configuration window combines the creation of a data center, a cluster, and storage into a single process.

⁠

**Procedure 7.4. Adding Local Storage**

1.  Use the **Hosts** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the host in the results list.
2.  Click **Maintenance** to open the **Maintenance Host(s)** confirmation window.
3.  Click **OK** to initiate maintenance mode.
4.  Click **Configure Local Storage** to open the **Configure Local Storage** window.
    ⁠

    ![Configure Local Storage Window](Configure Local Storage.png "Configure Local Storage Window")

    **Figure 7.2. Configure Local Storage Window**

5.  Click the **Edit** buttons next to the **Data Center**, **Cluster**, and **Storage** fields to configure and name the local storage domain.
6.  Set the path to your local storage in the text entry field.
7.  If applicable, select the **Optimization** tab to configure the memory optimization policy for the new local storage cluster.
8.  Click **OK** to save the settings and close the window.

**Result**

Your host comes online in a data center of its own.

### Adding POSIX Compliant File System Storage

oVirt 3.1 and higher supports the use of POSIX (native) file systems for storage. POSIX file system support allows you to mount file systems using the same mount options that you would normally use when mounting them manually from the command line. This functionality is intended to allow access to storage not exposed using NFS, iSCSI, or FCP.

Any POSIX compliant filesystem used as a storage domain in oVirt **MUST** support sparse files and direct I/O. The Common Internet File System (CIFS), for example, does not support direct I/O, making it incompatible with oVirt.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Do *not* mount NFS storage by creating a POSIX compliant file system Storage Domain. Always create an NFS Storage Domain instead.

</div>

#### Attaching POSIX Compliant File System Storage

**Summary**

You want to use a POSIX compliant file system that is not exposed using NFS, iSCSI, or FCP as a storage domain.

⁠

**Procedure 7.5. Attaching POSIX Compliant File System Storage**

1.  Click the **Storage** resource tab to list the existing storage domains in the results list.
2.  Click **New Domain** to open the **New Domain** window.
    ⁠

    ![POSIX Storage](New Domain Posix.png "POSIX Storage")

    **Figure 7.3. POSIX Storage**

3.  Enter the **Name** for the storage domain.
4.  Select the **Data Center** to be associated with the storage domain. The Data Center selected must be of type **POSIX (POSIX compliant FS)**. Alternatively, select `(none)`.
5.  Select `Data / POSIX compliant FS` from the **Domain Function / Storage Type** drop-down menu. If applicable, select the **Format** from the drop-down menu.
6.  Select a host from the **Use Host** drop-down menu. Only hosts within the selected data center will be listed. The host that you select will be used to connect the storage domain.
7.  Enter the **Path** to the POSIX file system, as you would normally provide it to the `mount` command.
8.  Enter the **VFS Type**, as you would normally provide it to the `mount` command using the *`-t`* argument. See `man mount` for a list of valid VFS types.
9.  Enter additional **Mount Options**, as you would normally provide them to the `mount` command using the *`-o`* argument. The mount options should be provided in a comma-separated list. See `man mount` for a list of valid mount options.
10. Click **OK** to attach the new Storage Domain and close the window.

**Result**

You have used a supported mechanism to attach an unsupported file system as a storage domain.

### Preparing and Adding Block Storage

#### Preparing iSCSI Storage

**Summary**

These steps must be taken to export iSCSI storage device from a server running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to use as a storage domain with oVirt.

⁠

**Procedure 7.6. Preparing iSCSI Storage**

1.  Install the **scsi-target-utils** package using the `yum` command as root on your storage server.
        # yum install -y scsi-target-utils

2.  Add the devices or files you want to export to the `/etc/tgt/targets.conf` file. Here is a generic example of a basic addition to the `targets.conf` file:
        <target iqn.YEAR-MONTH.com.EXAMPLE:SERVER.targetX>
                  backing-store /PATH/TO/DEVICE1 # Becomes LUN 1
                  backing-store /PATH/TO/DEVICE2 # Becomes LUN 2
                  backing-store /PATH/TO/DEVICE3 # Becomes LUN 3
        </target>

    Targets are conventionally defined using the year and month they are created, the reversed fully qualified domain that the server is in, the server name, and a target number.

3.  Start the **tgtd** service.
        # service tgtd start

4.  Make the **tgtd** start persistently across reboots.
        # chkconfig tgtd on

5.  Open an iptables firewall port to allow clients to access your iSCSI export. By default, iSCSI uses port 3260. This example inserts a firewall rule at position 6 in the INPUT table.
        # iptables -I INPUT 6 -p tcp --dport 3260 -j ACCEPT

6.  Save the iptables rule you just created.
        # service iptables save

**Result**

You have created a basic iSCSI export. You can use it as an iSCSI data domain.

#### Adding iSCSI Storage

**Summary**

oVirt platform supports iSCSI storage by creating a storage domain from a volume group made of pre-existing LUNs. Neither volume groups nor LUNs can be attached to more than one storage domain at a time.

For information regarding the setup and configuration of iSCSI on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see the *Red Hat Enterprise Linux Storage Administration Guide*.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can only add an iSCSI storage domain to a data center that is set up for iSCSI storage type.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 7.7. Adding iSCSI Storage**

1.  Click the **Storage** resource tab to list the existing storage domains in the results list.
2.  Click the **New Domain** button to open the **New Domain** window.
3.  Enter the **Name** of the new storage domain.
    ⁠

    ![New iSCSI Domain](New Domain iscsi.png "New iSCSI Domain")

    **Figure 7.4. New iSCSI Domain**

4.  Use the **Data Center** drop-down menu to select an iSCSI data center. If you do not yet have an appropriate iSCSI data center, select `(none)`.
5.  Use the drop-down menus to select the **Domain Function / Storage Type** and the **Format**. The storage domain types that are not compatible with the chosen data center are not available.
6.  Select an active host in the **Use Host** field. If this is not the first data domain in a data center, you must select the data center's SPM host.
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Important:** All communication to the storage domain is via the selected host and not directly from oVirt. At least one active host must exist in the system, and be attached to the chosen data center, before the storage is configured.

    </div>
7.  oVirt is able to map either iSCSI targets to LUNs, or LUNs to iSCSI targets. The **New Domain** window automatically displays known targets with unused LUNs when iSCSI is selected as the storage type. If the target that you are adding storage from is not listed then you can use target discovery to find it, otherwise proceed to the next step.
    **iSCSI Target Discovery**

    1.  Click **Discover Targets** to enable target discovery options. When targets have been discovered and logged in to, the **New Domain** window automatically displays targets with LUNs unused by the environment.
        <div class="alert alert-info">
        **Note:** LUNs used externally to the environment are also displayed.

        </div>
        You can use the **Discover Targets** options to add LUNs on many targets, or multiple paths to the same LUNs.

    2.  Enter the fully qualified domain name or IP address of the iSCSI host in the **Address** field.
    3.  Enter the port to connect to the host on when browsing for targets in the **Port** field. The default is `3260`.
    4.  If the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is being used to secure the storage, select the **User Authentication** check box. Enter the **CHAP user name** and **CHAP password**.
    5.  Click the **Discover** button.
    6.  Select the target to use from the discovery results and click the **Login** button. Alternatively, click the **Login All** to log in to all of the discovered targets.

8.  Click the **+** button next to the desired target. This will expand the entry and display all unused LUNs attached to the target.
9.  Select the check box for each LUN that you are using to create the storage domain.
10. Click **OK** to create the storage domain and close the window.

**Result**

The new iSCSI storage domain displays on the storage tab. This can take up to 5 minutes.

#### Adding FCP Storage

**Summary**

oVirt platform supports SAN storage by creating a storage domain from a volume group made of pre-existing LUNs. Neither volume groups nor LUNs can be attached to more than one storage domain at a time.

oVirt system administrators need a working knowledge of Storage Area Networks (SAN) concepts. SAN usually uses Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) for traffic between hosts and shared external storage. For this reason, SAN may occasionally be referred to as FCP storage.

For information regarding the setup and configuration of FCP or multipathing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please refer to the *Storage Administration Guide* and *DM Multipath Guide*.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can only add an FCP storage domain to a data center that is set up for FCP storage type.

</div>
**Procedure 7.8. Adding FCP Storage**

1.  Click the **Storage** resource tab to list all storage domains in the virtualized environment.
2.  Click **New Domain** to open the **New Domain** window.
3.  Enter the **Name** of the storage domain
    ⁠

    ![Adding FCP Storage](New Domain FCP.png "Adding FCP Storage")

    **Figure 7.5. Adding FCP Storage**

4.  Use the **Data Center** drop-down menu to select an FCP data center. If you do not yet have an appropriate FCP data center, select `(none)`.
5.  Use the drop-down menus to select the **Domain Function / Storage Type** and the **Format**. The storage domain types that are not compatible with the chosen data center are not available.
6.  Select an active host in the **Use Host** field. If this is not the first data domain in a data center, you must select the data center's SPM host.
    **Important**

    All communication to the storage domain is via the selected host and not directly from oVirt. At least one active host must exist in the system, and be attached to the chosen data center, before the storage is configured.

7.  The **New Domain** window automatically displays known targets with unused LUNs when **Data / Fibre Channel** is selected as the storage type. Select the **LUN ID** check box to select all of the available LUNs.
8.  Click **OK** to create the storage domain and close the window.

**Result**

The new FCP data domain displays on the **Storage** tab. It will remain with a `Locked` status while it is being prepared for use. When ready, it is automatically attached to the data center.

#### Unusable LUNs in oVirt

In certain circumstances, oVirt will not allow you to use a LUN to create a storage domain or virtual machine hard disk.

*   LUNs that are already part of the current oVirt environment are automatically prevented from being used.
*   LUNs that are already being used by the SPM host will also display as in use. You can choose to forcefully over ride the contents of these LUNs, but the operation is not guaranteed to succeed.

### Storage Tasks

#### Importing Existing ISO or Export Storage Domains

**Summary**

You have an ISO or export domain that you have been using with a different data center. You want to attach it to the data center you are using, and import virtual machines or use ISOs.

⁠

**Procedure 7.9. Importing an Existing ISO or Export Storage Domain**

1.  Click the **Storage** resource tab to list all the available storage domains in the results list.
2.  Click **Import Domain** to open the **Import Pre-Configured Domain** window.
    ⁠

    ![Import Domain](Import Domain.png "Import Domain")

    **Figure 7.6. Import Pre-Configured Domain**

3.  Select the appropriate **Domain Function / Storage Type** from the following:
    -   ISO
    -   Export

    The **Domain Function / Storage Type** determines the availability of the **Format** field.

4.  Select the SPM host from the **Use host** drop-down menu.
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Important:**All communication to the storage domain is via the selected host and not from oVirt. At least one host must be active and have access to the storage before the storage can be configured.

    </div>
5.  Enter the **Export path** of the storage. The export path can be either a static **IP address** or a resolvable hostname. For example, `192.168.0.10:/Images/ISO` or `storage.demo.redhat.com:/exports/iso`.
6.  Click **OK** to import the domain and close the window.
7.  The storage domain is imported and displays on the **Storage** tab. The next step is to attach it to a data center. This is described later in this chapter, .

**Result**

You have imported your export or ISO domain to you data center. Attach it to a data center to use it.

#### Populating the ISO Storage Domain

**Summary**

An ISO storage domain is attached to a data center, ISO images must be uploaded to it. oVirt provides an ISO uploader tool that ensures that the images are uploaded into the correct directory path, with the correct user permissions.

The creation of ISO images from physical media is not described in this document. It is assumed that you have access to the images required for your environment.

⁠

**Procedure 7.10. Populating the ISO Storage Domain**

1.  Copy the required ISO image to a temporary directory on the system running oVirt.
2.  Log in to the system running oVirt as the `root` user.
3.  Use the `engine-iso-uploader` command to upload the ISO image. This action will take some time, the amount of time varies depending on the size of the image being uploaded and available network bandwidth.
    ⁠

    **Example 7.1. ISO Uploader Usage**

    In this example the ISO image `RHEL6.iso` is uploaded to the ISO domain called `ISODomain` using NFS. The command will prompt for an administrative user name and password. The user name must be provided in the form *user name*@*domain*.

        # engine-iso-uploader --iso-domain=ISODomain upload RHEL6.iso

**Result**

The ISO image is uploaded and appears in the ISO storage domain specified. It is also available in the list of available boot media when creating virtual machines in the data center which the storage domain is attached to.

#### Moving Storage Domains to Maintenance Mode

**Summary**

Detaching and removing storage domains requires that they be in maintenance mode. This is required to redesignate another data domain as the master data domain.

Editing domains and expanding iSCSI domains by adding more LUNs can only be done when the domain is active.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Put any active ISO and export domains in maintenance mode using this procedure.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 7.11. Moving storage domains to maintenance mode**

1.  Use the **Storage** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the storage domain in the results list.
2.  Shut down and move all the virtual machines running on the storage domain.
3.  Click the **Data Centers** tab in the details pane.
4.  Click **Maintenance** to open the **Maintenance Storage Domain(s)** confirmation window.
5.  Click **OK** to initiate maintenance mode. The storage domain is deactivated and has an `Inactive` status in the results list.

**Result**

You can now edit, detach, remove, or reactivate the inactive storage domains from the data center.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can also activate, detach and place domains into maintenance mode using the Storage tab on the details pane of the data center it is associated with.

</div>

## Virtual Machines

### Introduction to Virtual Machines

A virtual machine is a software implementation of a computer. The oVirt environment enables you to create virtual desktops and virtual servers.

Virtual machines consolidate computing tasks and workloads. In traditional computing environments, workloads usually run on individually administered and upgraded servers. Virtual machines reduce the amount of hardware and administration required to run the same computing tasks and workloads.

### Supported Virtual Machine Operating Systems

The operating systems that can be virtualized as guest operating systems in oVirt are as follows:

**Note:** While Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 are supported, virtual machines running the 32-bit version of these operating systems cannot be shut down gracefully from the administration portal because there is no ACPI support in the 32-bit x86 kernel. To terminate virtual machines running the 32-bit version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, right-click the virtual machine and select the **Power Off** option.

### Creating Virtual Machines

#### Creating a Virtual Machine

**Summary**

You can create a virtual machine using a blank template and configure all of its settings.

**Procedure 8.1. Creating a Virtual Machine**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab.
2.  Click the **New VM** button to open the **New Virtual Machine** window.
    ⁠

    ![The New Virtual Machine Window](New Virtual Machine.png "The New Virtual Machine Window")

    **Figure 8.1. The New Virtual Machine Window**

3.  On the **General** tab, fill in the **Name** and **Operating System** fields. You can accept the default settings for other fields, or change them if required.
4.  Alternatively, click the **Initial Run**, **Console**, **Host**, **Resource Allocation**, **Boot Options**, and **Custom Properties** tabs in turn to define options for your virtual machine.
5.  Click **OK** to create the virtual machine and close the window. The **New Virtual Machine - Guide Me** window opens.
6.  Use the Guide Me buttons to complete configuration or click **Configure Later** to close the window.

**Result**

The new virtual machine is created and displays in the list of virtual machines with a status of `Down`. Before you can use this virtual machine, add at least one network interface and one virtual disk, and install an operating system.

#### Creating a Virtual Machine Based on a Template

**Summary**

You can create virtual machines based on templates. This allows you to create virtual machines that are pre-configured with an operating system, network interfaces, applications and other resources.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Virtual machines created based on a template depend on that template. This means that you cannot remove that template from oVirt if there is a virtual machine that was created based on that template. However, you can clone a virtual machine from a template to remove the dependency on that template.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 8.2. Creating a Virtual Machine Based on a Template**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab.
2.  Click the **New VM** button to open the **New Virtual Machine** window.
3.  Select the **Cluster** on which the virtual machine will run.
4.  Select a template from the **Based on Template** drop-down menu.
5.  Select a template sub version from the **Template Sub Version** drop-down menu.
6.  Enter a **Name**, **Description** and any **Comments**, and accept the default values inherited from the template in the rest of the fields. You can change them if needed.
7.  Click the **Show Advanced Options** button.
8.  Click the **Resource Allocation** tab.
    ![Provisioning - Thin](New Virtual Machine Resource Allocation.png "Provisioning - Thin")

    **Figure 8.2. Provisioning - Thin**

9.  Select the **Thin** radio button in the **Storage Allocation** area.
10. Select the disk provisioning policy from the **Allocation Policy** drop-down menu. This policy affects the speed of the clone operation and the amount of disk space the new virtual machine initially requires.
    -   Selecting **Thin Provision** results in a faster clone operation and provides optimized usage of storage capacity. Disk space is allocated only as it is required. This is the default selection.
    -   Selecting **Preallocated** results in a slower clone operation and provides optimized virtual machine read and write operations. All disk space requested in the template is allocated at the time of the clone operation.

11. Use the **Target** drop-down menu to select the storage domain on which the virtual machine's virtual disk will be stored.
12. Click **OK**.

**Result**

The virtual machine is created and displayed in the list in the **Virtual Machines** tab. You can now log on to the virtual machine and begin using it, or assign users to it.

#### Creating a Cloned Virtual Machine Based on a Template

**Summary**

Cloned virtual machines are similar to virtual machines based on templates. However, while a cloned virtual machine inherits settings in the same way as a virtual machine based on a template, a cloned virtual machine does not depend on the template on which it was based after it has been created.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** If you clone a virtual machine from a template, the name of the template on which that virtual machine was based is displayed in the **General** tab of the **Edit Virtual Machine** window for that virtual machine. If you change the name of that template, the name of the template in the **General** tab will also be updated. However, if you delete the template from oVirt, the original name of that template will be displayed instead.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 8.3. Cloning a Virtual Machine Based on a Template**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab.
2.  Click the **New VM** button to open the **New Virtual Machine** window.
3.  Select the **Cluster** on which the virtual machine will run.
4.  Select a template from the **Based on Template** drop-down menu.
5.  Select a template sub version from the **Template Sub Version** drop-down menu.
6.  Enter a **Name**, **Description** and any **Comments**. You can accept the default values inherited from the template in the rest of the fields, or change them if required.
7.  Click the **Show Advanced Options** button.
8.  Click the **Resource Allocation** tab.
    ![Provisioning - Clone](New Virtual Machine Clone Allocation.png "Provisioning - Clone")

    **Figure 8.3. Provisioning - Clone**

9.  Select the **Clone** radio button in the **Storage Allocation** area.
10. Select the disk provisioning policy from the **Allocation Policy** drop-down menu. This policy affects the speed of the clone operation and the amount of disk space the new virtual machine initially requires.
    -   Selecting **Thin Provision** results in a faster clone operation and provides optimized usage of storage capacity. Disk space is allocated only as it is required. This is the default selection.
    -   Selecting **Preallocated** results in a slower clone operation and provides optimized virtual machine read and write operations. All disk space requested in the template is allocated at the time of the clone operation.

11. Use the **Target** drop-down menu to select the storage domain on which the virtual machine's virtual disk will be stored.
12. Click **OK**.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Cloning a virtual machine may take some time. A new copy of the template's disk must be created. During this time, the virtual machine's status is first **Image Locked**, then **Down**.

</div>
**Result**

The virtual machine is created and displayed in the list in the **Virtual Machines** tab. You can now assign users to it, and can begin using it when the clone operation is complete.

#### Installing Windows on VirtIO-Optimized Hardware

**Summary**

The `virtio-win.vfd` diskette image contains Windows drivers for VirtIO-optimized disk and network devices. These drivers provide a performance improvement over emulated device drivers.

The `virtio-win.vfd` is placed automatically on ISO storage domains that are hosted on oVirt server. It must be manually uploaded using the **engine-iso-uploader** tool to other ISO storage domains.

You can install the VirtIO-optimized device drivers during your Windows installation by attaching a diskette to your virtual machine.

This procedure presumes that you added a `Red Hat VirtIO` network interface and a disk that uses the `VirtIO` interface to your virtual machine.

⁠

**Procedure 8.5. Installing VirtIO Drivers during Windows Installation**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Click the **Run Once** button, and the **Run Once** window displays.
3.  Click **Boot Options** to expand the **Boot Options** configuration options.
4.  Click the **Attach Floppy** check box, and select `virtio-win.vfd` from the drop down selection box.
5.  Click the **Attach CD** check box, and select from the drop down selection box the ISO containing the version of Windows you want to install.
6.  Move **CD-ROM** **UP** in the **Boot Sequence** field.
7.  Configure the rest of your **Run Once** options as required, and click **OK** to start your virtual machine, and then click the **Console** button to open a graphical console to your virtual machine.

**Result**

Windows installations include an option to load additional drivers early in the installation process. Use this option to load drivers from the `virtio-win.vfd` diskette that was attached to your virtual machine as `A:`.

For each supported virtual machine architecture and Windows version, there is a folder on the disk containing optimized hardware device drivers.

#### Virtual Machine Run Once Settings Explained

The **Run Once** window defines one-off boot options for a virtual machine. For persistent boot options, use the **Boot Options** tab in the **New Virtual Machine** window. The following table details the information required for the **Run Once** window.

**Summary**

Add a watchdog card to a virtual machine.

⁠

**Procedure 8.6. Adding a Watchdog Card to a Virtual Machine**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Virtual Machine** window.
3.  Click **Show Advanced Options** to display all tabs and click the **High Availability** tab.
4.  Select the watchdog model to use from the **Watchdog Model** drop-down menu.
5.  Select an action from the **Watchdog Action** drop-down menu. This is the action that the virtual machine takes when the watchdog is triggered.
6.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have added a watchdog card to the virtual machine.

##### Installing a Watchdog

**Summary**

To activate a watchdog card attached to a virtual machine, you must install the watchdog package on that virtual machine and start the `watchdog` service.

⁠

**Procedure 8.7. Installing a Watchdog**

1.  Log on to the virtual machine on which the watchdog card is attached.
2.  Run the following command to install the watchdog package and dependencies:
        # yum install watchdog

3.  Edit the `/etc/watchdog.conf` file and uncomment the following line:
        watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog

4.  Save the changes.
5.  Run the following commands to start the `watchdog` service and ensure this service starts on boot:
        # service watchdog start
        # chkconfig watchdog on

**Result**

You have installed and started the `watchdog` service on a virtual machine.

##### Confirming Watchdog Functionality

**Summary**

Confirm that a watchdog card has been attached to a virtual machine and that the `watchdog` service is active.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Warning:** This procedure is provided for testing the functionality of watchdogs only and must not be run on production machines.

</div>
⁠

**Procedure 8.8. Confirming Watchdog Functionality**

1.  Log on to the virtual machine on which the watchdog card is attached.
2.  Run the following command to confirm that the watchdog card has been identified by the virtual machine:
        # lspci | grep watchdog -i

3.  Run one of the following commands to confirm that the watchdog is active:
    -   Run the following command to trigger a kernel panic:
            # echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

    -   Run the following command to terminate the `watchdog` service:
            # kill -9 `pgrep watchdog`

**Result**

The watchdog timer can no longer be reset, so the watchdog counter reaches zero after a short period of time. When the watchdog counter reaches zero, the action specified in the **Watchdog Action** drop-down menu for that virtual machine is performed.

##### Parameters for Watchdogs in watchdog.conf

The following is a list of options for configuring the `watchdog` service available in the `/etc/watchdog.conf` file. To configure an option, you must ensure that option is uncommented and restart the `watchdog` service after saving the changes.

<div class="alert alert-info">

A console is a graphical window that allows you to view the start up screen, shut down screen and desktop of a virtual machine, and to interact with that virtual machine in a similar way to a physical machine. In oVirt, the default application for opening a console to a virtual machine is Remote Viewer, which must be installed on the client machine prior to use.

##### Installing Remote Viewer on Linux

Remote Viewer is an application for opening a graphical console to virtual machines. Remote Viewer is a SPICE client that is included the virt-viewer package provided by the `Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation (v. 6 for x86_64)` channel.

⁠

**Procedure 8.23. Installing Remote Viewer on Linux**

1.  Run the following command to install the spice-xpi package and dependencies:
        # yum install spice-xpi

2.  Run the following command to check whether the **virt-viewer** package has already been installed on your system:
        # rpm -q virt-viewer
        virt-viewer-0.5.2-18.el6_4.2.x86_64

    If the virt-viewer package has not been installed, run the following command to install the package and its dependencies:

        # yum install virt-viewer

3.  Restart Firefox for your changes to take effect.

The SPICE plug-in is now installed. You can now connect to your virtual machines using the SPICE protocol.

##### Installing Remote Viewer for Internet Explorer on Windows

**Summary**

The SPICE ActiveX component is required to run Remote Viewer, which opens a graphical console to virtual machines. Remote Viewer is a SPICE client installed together with the SPICE ActiveX component; both are provided in the `SpiceX.cab` file.

⁠

**Procedure 8.24. Installing Remote Viewer for Internet Explorer on Windows**

1.  Open Internet Explorer and log in to the User Portal.
2.  Start a virtual machine and attempt to connect to the virtual machine using the **Browser plugin** console option.

##### Installing Remote Viewer on Windows

The **Remote Viewer** application provides users with a graphical console for connecting to virtual machines. Once installed, it is called automatically when attempting to open a SPICE session with a virtual machine. Alternatively, it can also be used as a standalone application.

⁠

**Procedure 8.25. Installing Remote Viewer on Windows**

1.  Open a web browser and download one of the following installers according to the architecture of your system.
    -   Virt Viewer for 32-bit Windows:
            https://[your manager's address]/ovirt-engine/services/files/spice/virt-viewer-x86.msi

    -   Virt Viewer for 64-bit Windows:
            https://[your manager's address]/ovirt-engine/services/files/spice/virt-viewer-x64.msi

2.  Open the folder where the file was saved.
3.  Double-click the file.
4.  Click **Run** if prompted by a security warning.
5.  Click **Yes** if prompted by User Account Control.

**Result**

**Remote Viewer** is installed and can be accessed via **Remote Viewer** in the **VirtViewer** folder of **All Programs** in the start menu.

#### Guest Drivers and Agents

##### Installing Guest Agents and Drivers

Installing oVirt guest agents and drivers on virtual machines provides optimized performance and extra features.

<dl>
<dt>
Installing the agents and drivers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux guests
</dt>
<dd>
All of the drivers are included in the base channel for RHN-registered Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines. They can be installed using the `yum install rhevm-guest-agent` command. Your RHEL guest must be subscribed to the `Red Hat Enterprise Virt Agent` channel to install the agents. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, this channel is labeled `rhel-x86_64-rhev-agent-5-server`. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the channel is labeled `rhel-x86_64-rhev-agent-6-server`.
</dd>
<dt>
Installing the agents and drivers on Windows guests
</dt>
<dd>
The guest tools ISO is `ovirt-guest-tools-iso.rpm`, an RPM file installed on oVirt. After installing oVirt, the guest tools ISO can be found at `/usr/share/rhev-guest-tools-iso/ovirt-tools-setup.iso`. When setting up oVirt, if you have created a local storage share for an ISO storage domain, the ISO file is automatically copied to the ISO storage domain. In this case the ISO image is automatically attached to Windows guests when they are created. Otherwise, the ISO must be manually attached to Windows guests for the tools and agents to be installed. Updated versions of the ISO file must be manually attached to running Windows virtual machines to install updated versions of the tools and drivers. If the APT service is enabled on virtual machines, the updated ISO files will be automatically attached.
</dd>
</dl>

##### Automating Guest Additions on Windows Guests with oVirt Application Provisioning Tool(APT)

oVirt Application Provisioning Tool (APT) is a Windows service that can be installed in Windows virtual machines and templates. Attach the guest tools ISO file to your Windows virtual machine and **ovirt-Application Provisioning.exe** automatically runs to install the APT service.

When the APT service is installed on a virtual machine, attached ISO files are automatically scanned. When the service recognizes a valid oVirt guest tools ISO, and no other guest tools are installed, the APT service installs the guest tools. If guest tools are installed, and the ISO image contains newer versions of the tools, an upgrade is automatically performed.

When the APT service has successfully installed or upgraded guest tools on a virtual machine, the virtual machine is automatically rebooted.

##### oVirt Guest Drivers and Guest Agents

oVirt provides customized drivers and guest tools to use with Windows and Red Hat Enterprise Linux guests. The drivers allow guests to use enhanced virtual devices that perform better than emulated devices; the guest agents facilitate communication between the guest and oVirt.

SPICE

Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is the recommended connection protocol for both Linux virtual machines and Windows virtual machines. SPICE is installed and executed on the client that connects to the virtual machine.

VNC

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) can be used to open consoles to both Linux virtual machines and Windows virtual machines. To open a console to a virtual machine using VNC, you must use Remote Viewer or a VNC client.

RDP

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) can only be used to open consoles to Windows virtual machines, and is only available when you access a virtual machines from a Windows machine on which Remote Desktop has been installed. Moreover, before you can connect to a Windows virtual machine using RDP, you must set up remote sharing on the virtual machine and configure the firewall to allow remote desktop connections.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** SPICE is not currently supported on virtual machines running Windows 8. If a Windows 8 virtual machine is configured to use the SPICE protocol, it will detect the absence of the required SPICE drivers and automatically fall back to using RDP.

</div>

##### Accessing Console Options

In the Administration Portal, you can configure several options for opening graphical consoles for virtual machines, such as the method of invocation and whether to enable or disable USB redirection.

⁠

**Procedure 8.31. Accessing Console Options**

1.  Select a running virtual machine.
2.  Right-click the virtual machine and click the **Edit Console Options** button to open the **Console Options** window.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Further options specific to each of the connection protocols, such as the keyboard layout when using the VNC connection protocol, can be configured in the **Console** tab of the **Edit Virtual Machine** window.

</div>

##### SPICE Console Options

When the SPICE connection protocol is selected, the following options are available in the **Console Options** window.

### ⁠Affinity Groups

#### Introduction to Virtual Machine Affinity

Virtual machine affinity allows you to define sets of rules that specify whether certain virtual machines run together on the same host or run separately on different hosts. This allows you to create advanced workload scenarios for addressing challenges such as strict licensing requirements and workloads demanding high availability.

Virtual machine affinity is applied to virtual machines by adding virtual machines to one or more affinity groups. An affinity group is a group of two or more virtual machines for which a set of identical parameters and conditions apply. These parameters include positive (run together) affinity that ensures the virtual machines in an affinity group run on the same host, and negative (run independently) affinity that ensures the virtual machines in an affinity group run on different hosts.

A further set of conditions can then be applied to these parameters. For example, you can apply hard enforcement, which is a condition that ensures the virtual machines in the affinity group run on the same host or different hosts regardless of external conditions, or soft enforcement, which is a condition that indicates a preference for virtual machines in an affinity group to run on the same host or different hosts when possible.

The combination of an affinity group, its parameters and conditions are collectively known as an affinity policy.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Affinity groups are applied to virtual machines on the cluster level. When a virtual machine is moved from one cluster to another, that virtual machine is removed from all affinity groups in the source cluster.

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Affinity groups will only take effect when the `VmAffinityGroups` filter module or weights module is enabled in the cluster policy applied to clusters in which affinity groups are defined. The `VmAffinityGroups` filter module is used to implement hard enforcement, and the `VmAffinityGroups` weights module is used to implement soft enforcement.

</div>

#### Creating an Affinity Group

**Summary**

You can create new affinity groups for applying affinity policies to virtual machines.

⁠

**Procedure 8.37. Creating an Affinity Group**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Click the **Affinity Groups** tab in the details pane.
3.  Click the **New** button to open the **New Affinity Group** window.
4.  Enter a name and description for the affinity group in the **Name** text field and **Description** text field.
5.  Select the **Positive** check box to apply positive affinity, or ensure this check box is cleared to apply negative affinity.
6.  Select the **Enforcing** check box to apply hard enforcement, or ensure this check box is cleared to apply soft enforcement.
7.  Use the drop-down menu to select the virtual machines to be added to the affinity group. Use the **+** and **-** buttons to add or remove additional virtual machines.
8.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have created a virtual machine affinity group and specified the parameters and conditions to be applied to the virtual machines that are members of that group.

#### Editing an Affinity Group

You have removed an affinity group, and the affinity policy that applied to the virtual machines that were members of that affinity group no longer applies.

### ⁠Importing and Exporting Virtual Machines

#### Exporting and Importing Virtual Machines and Templates

Virtual machines and templates can be exported from and imported to data centers in the same oVirt environment, or a different oVirt environment. oVirt allows you to import and export virtual machines (and templates) stored in Open Virtual Machine Format (OVF).

There are three stages to exporting and importing virtual machines and templates:

1.  Export the virtual machine or template to an export domain.
2.  Detach the export domain from one data center, and attach it to another. You can attach it to a different data center in the same oVirt environment, or attach it to a data center in a separate oVirt environment that is managed by another installation of oVirt.
3.  Import the virtual machine or template into the data center to which the export domain is attached.

A virtual machine must be stopped before it can be moved across data centers. If the virtual machine was created using a template, the template must exist in the destination data center for the virtual machine to work, or the virtual machine must be exported with the **Collapse Snapshots** option selected.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** When you export or import a virtual machine or template, the properties of that virtual machine or template are preserved, including basic details such as the name and description, resource allocation, and high availability settings.

</div>

#### Overview of the Export and Import Process

The export domain allows you to move virtual machines and templates between oVirt environments.

To export or import virtual machines and templates, an active export domain must be attached to the data center containing the virtual machine or template to be exported or imported. An export domain acts as a temporary storage area containing two directories for each exported virtual machine or template. One directory contains the OVF (Open Virtualization Format) files for the virtual machine or template. The other directory holds the disk image or images for the virtual machine or template.

You can also import virtual machines from other virtualization providers such as Xen, VMware or Windows virtual machines using the V2V feature. V2V converts virtual machines and places them in the export domain.

For more information on V2V, see the *Red Hat Enterprise Linux V2V Guide*.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** An export domain can only be active in one data center at a given time. This means that the export domain must be attached to either the source data center or the destination data center.

</div>
Exporting virtual machines and templates from one data center to another requires some preparation. Ensure that:

*   An export domain exists, and is attached to the source data center.
*   The virtual machine is shut down.
*   If the virtual machine was created based on a template, that template must reside on the destination data center or be exported with the virtual machine.

When the virtual machine or template has been exported to the export domain, you can import that virtual machine or template into the destination data center. If the destination data center is in the same oVirt environment as the source data center, delete the original virtual machine or template from the source data center after the export has completed.

#### Graphical Overview for Exporting and Importing Virtual Machines and Templates

**Summary**

This procedure provides a graphical overview of the steps required to export a virtual machine or template from one data center and import that virtual machine or template into another data center.

⁠

**Procedure 8.40. Exporting and Importing Virtual Machines and Templates**

1.  Attach the export domain to the source data center.
    ⁠

    ![Attach Export Domain](Export1.png "Attach Export Domain")

    ![Import the virtual resource](Export5.png "Import the virtual resource")

    **Figure 8.17. Import the virtual resource**

**Result**

The virtual machine or template is imported to the destination data center.

#### Exporting a Virtual Machine to the Export Domain

**Summary**

Export a virtual machine to the export domain so that it can be imported into a different data center. Before you begin, the export domain must be attached to the data center that contains the virtual machine to be exported.

⁠

**Procedure 8.41. Exporting a Virtual Machine to the Export Domain**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Click **Export** to open the **Export Virtual Machine** window.
3.  Select the **Force Override** check box to override existing images of the virtual machine on the export domain. Select the **Collapse Snapshots** check box to create a single export volume per disk. Selecting this option will remove snapshot restore points and include the template in a template-based virtual machine. This removes any dependencies a virtual machine has on a template.
4.  Click **OK** to export the virtual machine and close the window.

**Result**

The export of the virtual machine begins. The virtual machine displays in the Virtual Machines list with an `Image Locked` status as it is exported. Depending on the size of your virtual machine hard disk images, and your storage hardware, this can take up to an hour. Use the **Events** tab to view the progress.

When complete, the virtual machine has been exported to the export domain and displays on the **VM Import** tab of the export domain's details pane.

#### Importing a Virtual Machine into the Destination Data Center

**Summary**

You have a virtual machine on an export domain. Before the virtual machine can be imported to a new data center, the export domain must be attached to the destination data center.

⁠

**Procedure 8.42. Importing a Virtual Machine into the Destination Data Center**

1.  Use the **Storage** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the export domain in the results list. The export domain must have a status of `Active`
2.  Select the **VM Import** tab in the details pane to list the available virtual machines to import.
3.  Select one or more virtual machines to import and click **Import** to open the **Import Virtual Machine(s)** window.
4.  Use the drop-down menus to select the **Default Storage Domain** and **Cluster**.
5.  Select the **Collapse Snapshots** check box to remove snapshot restore points and include templates in template-based virtual machines.
6.  Click the virtual machine to be imported and click on the **Disks** sub-tab. From this tab, you can use the **Allocation Policy** and **Storage Domain** drop-down lists to select whether the disk used by the virtual machine will be thinly provisioned or preallocated, and can also select the storage domain on which the disk will be stored. An icon is also displayed to indicate which of the disks to be imported acts as the boot disk for that virtual machine.
7.  Click **OK** to import the virtual machines The **Import Conflict** window opens if the virtual machine exists in the virtualized environment.
8.  Choose one of the following radio buttons:
    -   **Don't import**
    -   **Clone** and enter a unique name for the virtual machine in the **New Name** field.

    Or select the **Apply to all** check box to import all duplicated virtual machines with the same suffix.

9.  Click **OK** to import the virtual machines and close the window.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** During a single import operation, you can only import virtual machines that share the same architecture. If any of the virtual machines to be imported have a different architecture to that of the other virtual machines to be imported, a warning will display and you will be prompted to change your selection so that only virtual machines with the same architecture will be imported.

</div>
**Result**

You have imported the virtual machine to the destination data center. This may take some time to complete.

### ⁠Migrating Virtual Machines Between Hosts

#### What is Live Migration?

Live migration provides the ability to move a running virtual machine between physical hosts with no interruption to service.

Live migration is transparent to the end user: the virtual machine remains powered on and user applications continue to run while the virtual machine is relocated to a new physical host.

#### Live Migration Prerequisites

Live migration is used to seamlessly move virtual machines to support a number of common maintenance tasks. Ensure that your oVirt environment is correctly configured to support live migration well in advance of using it.

At a minimum, for successful live migration of virtual machines to be possible:

*   The source and destination host must both be members of the same cluster, ensuring CPU compatibility between them.
*   The source and destination host must have a status of `Up`.
*   The source and destination host must have access to the same virtual networks and VLANs.
*   The source and destination host must have access to the data storage domain on which the virtual machine resides.
*   There must be enough CPU capacity on the destination host to support the virtual machine's requirements.
*   There must be enough RAM on the destination host that is not in use to support the virtual machine's requirements.
*   The migrating virtual machine must not have the `cache!=none` custom property set.

In addition, for best performance, the storage and management networks should be split to avoid network saturation. Virtual machine migration involves transferring large amounts of data between hosts.

Live migration is performed using the management network. Each live migration event is limited to a maximum transfer speed of 30 MBps, and the number of concurrent migrations supported is also limited by default. Despite these measures, concurrent migrations have the potential to saturate the management network. It is recommended that separate logical networks are created for storage, display, and virtual machine data to minimize the risk of network saturation.

#### Automatic Virtual Machine Migration

oVirt automatically initiates live migration of all virtual machines running on a host when the host is moved into maintenance mode. The destination host for each virtual machine is assessed as the virtual machine is migrated, in order to spread the load across the cluster.

oVirt automatically initiates live migration of virtual machines in order to maintain load balancing or power saving levels in line with cluster policy. While no cluster policy is defined by default, it is recommended that you specify the cluster policy which best suits the needs of your environment. You can also disable automatic, or even manual, live migration of specific virtual machines where required.

#### Preventing Automatic Migration of a Virtual Machine

**Summary**

oVirt allows you to disable automatic migration of virtual machines. You can also disable manual migration of virtual machines by setting the virtual machine to run only on a specific host.

The ability to disable automatic migration and require a virtual machine to run on a particular host is useful when using application high availability products, such as Red Hat High Availability or Cluster Suite.

**Procedure 8.43. Preventing automatic migration of a virtual machine**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Virtual Machine** window.
3.  Click the **Hide Advanced Options** button.

You have changed the migration settings for the virtual machine.

#### Manually Migrating Virtual Machines

**Summary**

A running virtual machine can be migrated to any host within its designated host cluster. This is especially useful if the load on a particular host is too high. When bringing a server down for maintenance, migration is triggered automatically, so manual migration is not required. Migration of virtual machines does not cause any service interruption.

The migrating virtual machine must not have the `cache!=none` custom property set.

**Procedure 8.44. Manually Migrating Virtual Machines**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a running virtual machine.
2.  Click **Migrate** to open the **Migrate Virtual Machine(s)** window.
3.  Use the radio buttons to select whether to **Select Host Automatically** or to **Select Destination Host**, specifying the host using the drop-down menu.
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Note:** Virtual Machines migrate within their designated host cluster. When the **Select Host Automatically** option is selected, the system determines the host to which the virtual is migrated according to the load balancing and power management rules set up in the cluster policy.

    </div>
4.  Click **OK** to commence migration and close the window.

**Result**

The virtual machine is migrated. Once migration is complete the **Host** column will update to display the host the virtual machine has been migrated to.

#### Setting Migration Priority

**Summary**

oVirt queues concurrent requests for migration of virtual machines off of a given host. Every minute the load balancing process runs. Hosts already involved in a migration event are not included in the migration cycle until their migration event has completed. When there is a migration request in the queue and available hosts in the cluster to action it, a migration event is triggered in line with the load balancing policy for the cluster.

It is possible to influence the ordering of the migration queue, for example setting mission critical virtual machines to migrate before others. oVirt allows you to set the priority of each virtual machine to facilitate this. Virtual machines migrations will be ordered by priority, those virtual machines with the highest priority will be migrated first.

⁠

**Procedure 8.45. Setting Migration Priority**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Virtual Machine** window.
3.  Select the **High Availability** tab.
4.  Use the radio buttons to set the **Priority for Run/Migrate Queue** of the virtual machine to one of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.
5.  Click **OK** to save changes and close the window.

**Result**

The virtual machine's migration priority has been modified.

#### Canceling Ongoing Virtual Machine Migrations

**Summary**

A virtual machine migration is taking longer than you expected. You'd like to be sure where all virtual machines are running before you make any changes to your environment.

⁠

**Procedure 8.46. Canceling Ongoing Virtual Machine Migrations**

1.  Select the migrating virtual machine. It is displayed in the **Virtual Machines** resource tab with a status of **Migrating from**.
2.  Click the **Cancel Migration** button at the top of the results list. Alternatively, right-click on the virtual machine and select **Cancel Migration** from the context menu.

**Result**

The virtual machine status returns from **Migrating from** status to **Up** status.

#### Event and Log Notification upon Automatic Migration of Highly Available Virtual Servers

When a virtual server is automatically migrated because of the high availability function, the details of an automatic migration are documented in the **Events** tab and in the engine log to aid in troubleshooting, as illustrated in the following examples:

⁠

**Example 8.1. Notification in the Events Tab of the Web Admin Portal**

Highly Available *Virtual_Machine_Name* failed. It will be restarted automatically.

*Virtual_Machine_Name* was restarted on Host *Host_Name*

⁠

**Example 8.2. Notification in oVirt engine.log**

This log can be found on oVirt at `/var/log/ovirt-engine/engine.log`:

Failed to start Highly Available VM. Attempting to restart. VM Name: *Virtual_Machine_Name*, VM Id:*Virtual_Machine_ID_Number*

### ⁠Improving Uptime with Virtual Machine High Availability

#### Why Use High Availability?

High availability is recommended for virtual machines running critical workloads.

High availability can ensure that virtual machines are restarted in the following scenarios:

*   When a host becomes non-operational due to hardware failure.
*   When a host is put into maintenance mode for scheduled downtime.
*   When a host becomes unavailable because it has lost communication with an external storage resource.

A high availability virtual machine is automatically restarted, either on its original host or another host in the cluster.

#### What is High Availability?

High availability means that a virtual machine will be automatically restarted if its process is interrupted. This happens if the virtual machine is terminated by methods other than powering off from within the guest or sending the shutdown command from oVirt. When these events occur, the highly available virtual machine is automatically restarted, either on its original host or another host in the cluster.

High availability is possible because oVirt constantly monitors the hosts and storage, and automatically detects hardware failure. If host failure is detected, any virtual machine configured to be highly available is automatically restarted on another host in the cluster.

With high availability, interruption to service is minimal because virtual machines are restarted within seconds with no user intervention required. High availability keeps your resources balanced by restarting guests on a host with low current resource utilization, or based on any workload balancing or power saving policies that you configure. This ensures that there is sufficient capacity to restart virtual machines at all times.

#### High Availability Considerations

A highly available host requires a power management device and its fencing parameters configured. In addition, for a virtual machine to be highly available when its host becomes non-operational, it needs to be started on another available host in the cluster. To enable the migration of highly available virtual machines:

*   Power management must be configured for the hosts running the highly available virtual machines.
*   The host running the highly available virtual machine must be part of a cluster which has other available hosts.
*   The destination host must be running.
*   The source and destination host must have access to the data domain on which the virtual machine resides.
*   The source and destination host must have access to the same virtual networks and VLANs.
*   There must be enough CPUs on the destination host that are not in use to support the virtual machine's requirements.
*   There must be enough RAM on the destination host that is not in use to support the virtual machine's requirements.

#### Configuring a Highly Available Virtual Machine

**Summary**

High availability must be configured individually for each virtual machine.

**Procedure 8.47. Configuring a Highly Available Virtual Machine**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Virtual Machine** window.
3.  Click the **Show Advanced Options** button.
4.  Click the **High Availability** tab.
5.  Select the **Highly Available** check box to enable high availability for the virtual machine.
6.  Use the radio buttons to set the **Priority for Run/Migrate Queue** of the virtual machine to one of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**. When migration is triggered, a queue is created in which the high priority virtual machines are migrated first. If a cluster is running low on resources, only the high priority virtual machines are migrated.
7.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have configured high availability for a virtual machine. You can check if a virtual machine is highly available by selecting the virtual machine and clicking on the **General** tab in the details pane.

#### Configuring Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 or Higher Virtual Machines to use SPICE

##### Using SPICE on virtual machines running versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux released prior to 5.4

SPICE is a remote display protocol designed for virtual environments, which enables you to view a virtualized desktop or server. SPICE delivers a high quality user experience, keeps CPU consumption low, and supports high quality video streaming.

Using SPICE on a Linux machine significantly improves the movement of the mouse cursor on the console of the virtual machine. To use SPICE, the X-Windows system requires additional qxl drivers. The qxl drivers are provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 and newer. Older versions are not supported. Installing SPICE on a virtual machine running Red Hat Enterprise Linux significantly improves the performance of the graphical user interface.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Typically, this is most useful for virtual machines where the user requires the use of the graphical user interface. System administrators who are creating virtual servers may prefer not to configure SPICE if their use of the graphical user interface is minimal.

#### KVM Virtual Machine Timing Management

Virtualization poses various challenges for virtual machine time keeping. Virtual machines which use the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) as a clock source may suffer timing issues as some CPUs do not have a constant Time Stamp Counter. Virtual machines running without accurate timekeeping can have serious affects on some networked applications as your virtual machine will run faster or slower than the actual time.

KVM works around this issue by providing virtual machines with a paravirtualized clock. The KVM `pvclock` provides a stable source of timing for KVM guests that support it.

Presently, only Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS 5.4 and higher virtual machines fully support the paravirtualized clock.

Virtual machines can have several problems caused by inaccurate clocks and counters:

*   Clocks can fall out of synchronization with the actual time which invalidates sessions and affects networks.
*   Virtual machines with slower clocks may have issues migrating.

These problems exist on other virtualization platforms and timing should always be tested.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** The Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon should be running on the host and the virtual machines. Enable the `ntpd` service:

    # service ntpd start

Add the ntpd service to the default startup sequence:

    # chkconfig ntpd on

Using the `ntpd` service should minimize the affects of clock skew in all cases.

</div>
The NTP servers you are trying to use must be operational and accessible to your hosts and virtual machines.

Determining if your CPU has the constant Time Stamp Counter

Your CPU has a constant Time Stamp Counter if the `constant_tsc` flag is present. To determine if your CPU has the `constant_tsc` flag run the following command:

    $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep constant_tsc

If any output is given your CPU has the `constant_tsc` bit. If no output is given follow the instructions below.

Configuring Hosts Without a Constant Time Stamp Counter

Systems without constant time stamp counters require additional configuration. Power management features interfere with accurate time keeping and must be disabled for virtual machines to accurately keep time with KVM.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** These instructions are for AMD revision F CPUs only.

</div>
If the CPU lacks the `constant_tsc` bit, disable all power management features ([BZ#513138](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=513138)). Each system has several timers it uses to keep time. The TSC is not stable on the host, which is sometimes caused by `cpufreq` changes, deep C state, or migration to a host with a faster TSC. Deep C sleep states can stop the TSC. To prevent the kernel using deep C states append "`processor.max_cstate=1`" to the kernel boot options in the `grub.conf` file on the host:

    term Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (2.6.18-159.el5)
            root (hd0,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-159.el5 ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet processor.max_cstate=1

Disable `cpufreq` (only necessary on hosts without the `constant_tsc`) by editing the `/etc/sysconfig/cpuspeed` configuration file and change the `MIN_SPEED` and `MAX_SPEED` variables to the highest frequency available. Valid limits can be found in the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies` files.

Using the `engine-config` tool to receive alerts when hosts drift out of sync.

You can use the `engine-config` tool to configure alerts when your hosts drift out of sync.

There are two relevant parameters for time drift on hosts: `EnableHostTimeDrift` and `HostTimeDriftInSec`. `EnableHostTimeDrift`, with a default value of false, can be enabled to receive alert notifications of host time drift. The `HostTimeDriftInSec` parameter is used to set the maximum allowable drift before alerts start being sent.

Alerts are sent once per hour per host.

Using the Paravirtualized Clock with Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS virtual machines

For certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS virtual machines, additional kernel parameters are required. These parameters can be set by appending them to the end of the /kernel line in the /boot/grub/grub.conf file of the virtual machine.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** The process of configuring kernel parameters can be automated using the `ktune` package

</div>
The `ktune` package provides an interactive Bourne shell script, `fix_clock_drift.sh`. When run as the superuser, this script inspects various system parameters to determine if the virtual machine on which it is run is susceptible to clock drift under load. If so, it then creates a new `grub.conf.kvm` file in the `/boot/grub/` directory. This file contains a kernel boot line with additional kernel parameters that allow the kernel to account for and prevent significant clock drift on the KVM virtual machine. After running `fix_clock_drift.sh` as the superuser, and once the script has created the `grub.conf.kvm` file, then the virtual machine's current `grub.conf` file should be backed up manually by the system administrator, the new `grub.conf.kvm` file should be manually inspected to ensure that it is identical to `grub.conf` with the exception of the additional boot line parameters, the `grub.conf.kvm` file should finally be renamed `grub.conf`, and the virtual machine should be rebooted.

The table below lists versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the parameters required for virtual machines on systems without a constant Time Stamp Counter.

Using the Real-Time Clock with Windows Virtual Machines

Windows uses the both the Real-Time Clock (RTC) and the Time Stamp Counter (TSC). For Windows virtual machines the Real-Time Clock can be used instead of the TSC for all time sources which resolves virtual machine timing issues.

To enable the Real-Time Clock for the PMTIMER clocksource (the PMTIMER usually uses the TSC) add the following line to the Windows boot settings. Windows boot settings are stored in the boot.ini file. Add the following line to the `boot.ini` file:

    /use pmtimer

For more information on Windows boot settings and the pmtimer option, refer to [Available switch options for the Windows XP and the Windows Server 2003 Boot.ini files](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/833721).

#### Monitoring Virtual Machine Login Activity Using the Sessions Tab

## ⁠Templates

### Introduction to Templates

A template is a copy of a preconfigured virtual machine, used to simplify the subsequent, repeated creation of similar virtual machines. Templates capture installed software and software configurations, as well as the hardware configuration, of the original virtual machine.

When you create a template from a virtual machine, a read-only copy of the virtual machine's disk is taken. The read-only disk becomes the base disk image of the new template, and of any virtual machines created from the template. As such, the template cannot be deleted whilst virtual machines created from the template exist in the environment.

Virtual machines created from a template use the same NIC type and driver as the original virtual machine, but utilize separate and unique MAC addresses.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** A virtual machine may require to be sealed before being used to create a template.

</div>

### Template Tasks

#### Creating a Template

**Summary**

Create a template from an existing virtual machine to use as a blueprint for creating additional virtual machines.

**Procedure 9.1. Creating a Template from an Existing Virtual Machine**

1.  Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.
2.  Ensure the virtual machine is powered down and has a status of `Down`.
3.  Click **Make Template** to open the **New Template** window.
    ![The New Template window](New Template.png "fig:The New Template window")
    **Figure 9.1. The New Template window**
4.  Enter a **Name**, **Description**, and **Comment** for the template.
5.  From the **Cluster** drop-down menu, select the cluster with which the template will be associated. By default, this will be the same as that of the source virtual machine.
6.  Optionally, select the **Create as a Sub Template version** check box, select a **Root Template** and enter a **Sub Version Name** to create the new template as a sub template of an existing template.
7.  In the **Disks Allocation** section, enter an alias for the disk in the **Alias** text field and select the storage domain on which the disk will be stored from the **Target** drop-down list. By default, these will be the same as those of the source virtual machine.
8.  The **Allow all users to access this Template** check box is selected by default. This makes the template public.
9.  The **Copy VM permissions** check box is not selected by default. Select this check box to copy the permissions of the source virtual machine to the template.
10. Click **OK**.

**Result**

The virtual machine displays a status of `Image Locked` while the template is being created. The process of creating a template may take up to an hour depending on the size of the virtual machine disk and your storage hardware. When complete, the template is added to the **Templates** tab. You can now create new virtual machines based on the template.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** When a template is made, the virtual machine is copied so that both the existing virtual machine and its template are usable after template creation.

### Sealing Virtual Machines in Preparation for Deployment as Templates

#### Sealing a Linux Virtual Machine for Deployment as a Template

##### Sealing a Linux Virtual Machine for Deployment as a Template

There are two main methods for sealing a Linux virtual machine in preparation for using that virtual machine to create a template: manually, or using the `sys-unconfig` command. Sealing a Linux virtual machine manually requires you to create a file on the virtual machine that acts as a flag for initiating various configuration tasks the next time you start that virtual machine. The `sys-unconfig` command allows you to automate this process. However, both of these methods also require you to manually delete files on the virtual machine that are specific to that virtual machine or might cause conflicts amongst virtual machines created based on the template you will create based on that virtual machine. As such, both are valid methods for sealing a Linux virtual machine and will achieve the same result.

##### Sealing a Linux Virtual Machine Manually for Deployment as a Template

**Summary**

You must generalize (seal) a Linux virtual machine before creating a template based on that virtual machine.

⁠**Procedure 9.7. Sealing a Linux Virtual Machine**

1.  Log in to the virtual machine.
2.  Flag the system for re-configuration by running the following command as root:
        # touch /.unconfigured

3.  Run the following command to remove ssh host keys:
        # rm -rf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*

4.  Set `HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain` in `/etc/sysconfig/network`
5.  Run the following command to remove `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-*`:
        # rm -rf /etc/udev/rules.d/70-*

6.  Remove the `HWADDR` line and `UUID` line from `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth*`.
7.  Optionally, delete all the logs from `/var/log` and build logs from `/root`.
8.  Run the following command to shut down the virtual machine:
        # poweroff

**Result**

The virtual machine is sealed and can be made into a template. You can deploy Linux virtual machines from this template without experiencing configuration file conflicts.

##### Sealing a Linux Virtual Machine for Deployment as a Template using sys-unconfig

**Summary**

You must generalize (seal) a Linux virtual machine before creating a template based on that virtual machine.

**Procedure 9.8. Sealing a Linux Virtual Machine using sys-unconfig**

1.  Log in to the virtual machine.
2.  Run the following command to remove ssh host keys:
        # rm -rf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*

3.  Set `HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain` in `/etc/sysconfig/network`.
4.  Remove the `HWADDR` line and `UUID` line from `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth*`.
5.  Optionally, delete all the logs from `/var/log` and build logs from `/root`.
6.  Run the following command:
        # sys-unconfig

**Result**

The virtual machine shuts down; it is now sealed and can be made into a template. You can deploy Linux virtual machines from this template without experiencing configuration file conflicts.

#### Sealing a Windows Virtual Machine for Deployment as a Template

##### Considerations when Sealing a Windows Template with Sysprep

A template created for Windows virtual machines must be generalized (sealed) before being used to deploy virtual machines. This ensures that machine-specific settings are not reproduced in the template.

The **Sysprep** tool is used to seal Windows templates before use.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Do not reboot the virtual machine during this process.

</div>
Before starting the `Sysprep` process, verify the following settings are configured:

*   The Windows **Sysprep** parameters have been correctly defined. If not, click **Edit** and enter the required information in the **Operating System** and **Domain** fields.
*   The correct product key has been entered in the `engine-config` configuration tool. If not, run the configuration tool on oVirt as the root user, and enter the required information. The configuration keys that you need to set are `ProductKey` and `SysPrepPath`. For example, the Windows 7 configuration value is `ProductKeyWindow7` and `SysPrepWindows7Path`. Set these values with this command:
        # engine-config --set ProductKeyWindow7=<validproductkey> --cver=general

##### Sealing a Windows XP Template

**Summary**

Seal a Windows XP template using the **Sysprep** tool before using the template to deploy virtual machines.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** You can also use the procedure above to seal a Windows 2003 template. The Windows 2003 **Sysprep** tool is available at [<http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=14830>](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=14830).

</div>
⁠

2.  Create a new directory: `c:\sysprep`.
3.  Open the `deploy.cab` file and add its contents to `c:\sysprep`.
4.  Execute `sysprep.exe` from within the folder and click **OK** on the welcome message to display the Sysprep tool.
5.  Select the following check boxes:
    -   **Don't reset grace period for activation**
    -   **Use Mini-Setup**

6.  Ensure that the shutdown mode is set to `Shut down` and click **Reseal**.
7.  Acknowledge the pop-up window to complete the sealing process; the virtual machine shuts down automatically upon completion.

**Result**

The Windows XP template is sealed and ready for deploying virtual machines.

##### Sealing a Windows 7 or Windows 2008 Template

**Summary**

Seal a Windows 7 or Windows 2008 template before using the template to deploy virtual machines.

⁠

**Procedure 9.10. Sealing a Windows 7 or Windows 2008 Template**

1.  In the virtual machine to be used as a template, open a command line terminal and type `regedit`.
2.  The **Registry Editor** window opens. On the left pane, expand **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** → **SYSTEM** → **SETUP**.
3.  On the main window, right-click to add a new string value using **New** → **String Value**.

7.  Enter the following information into the **Sysprep** tool:
    -   Under **System Cleanup Action**, select **Enter System Out-of-Box-Experience (OOBE)**.
    -   Select the **Generalize** check box if you need to change the computer's system identification number (SID).
    -   Under **Shutdown Options**, select **Shutdown**.

    Click **OK** to complete the sealing process; the virtual machine shuts down automatically upon completion.

**Result**

The Windows 7 or Windows 2008 template is sealed and ready for deploying virtual machines.

#### Using Cloud-Init to Automate the Configuration of Virtual Machines

##### Cloud-Init Overview

Cloud-Init is a tool for automating the initial setup of virtual machines such as configuring the host name, network interfaces, and authorized keys. It can be used when provisioning virtual machines that have been deployed based on a template to avoid conflicts on the network.

To use this tool, the cloud-init package must first be installed on the virtual machine. Once installed, the Cloud-Init service starts during the boot process to search for instructions on what to configure. You can then use options in the **Run Once** window to provide these instructions one time only, or options in the **New Virtual Machine**, **Edit Virtual Machine** and **Edit Template** windows to provide these instructions every time the virtual machine starts.

##### Cloud-Init Use Case Scenarios

Cloud-Init can be used to automate the configuration of virtual machines in a variety of scenarios. Several common scenarios are as follows:

Virtual Machines Created Based on Templates  
You can use the Cloud-Init options in the **Initial Run** section of the **Run Once** window to initialize a virtual machine that was created based on a template. This allows you to customize the virtual machine the first time that virtual machine is started.

Virtual Machine Templates  
You can use the **Use Cloud-Init/Sysprep** options in the **Initial Run** tab of the **New Template** and **Edit Template** windows to specify options for customizing virtual machines created based on that template.

Virtual Machine Pools  
You can use the **Use Cloud-Init/Sysprep** options in the **Initial Run** tab of the **New Pool** window to specify options for customizing virtual machines taken from that virtual machine pool. This allows you to specify a set of standard settings that will be applied every time a virtual machine is taken from that virtual machine pool. You can inherit or override the options specified for the template on which the virtual machine is based, or specify options for the virtual machine pool itself.

##### Installing Cloud-Init

**Summary**

Install Cloud-Init on a Red Hat or CentOS virtual machine.

**Procedure 9.11. Installing Cloud-Init**

1.  Log on to the virtual machine.

## ⁠Pools

### Introduction to Virtual Machine Pools

A virtual machine pool is a group of virtual machines that are all clones of the same template and that can be used on demand by any user in a given group. Virtual machine pools allow administrators to rapidly configure a set of generalized virtual machines for users.

Users access a virtual machine pool by taking a virtual machine from the pool. When a user takes a virtual machine from a pool, they are provided with any one of the virtual machines in the pool if any are available. That virtual machine will have the same operating system and configuration as that of the template on which the pool was based, but users may not receive the same member of the pool each time they take a virtual machine. Users can also take multiple virtual machines from the same virtual machine pool depending on the configuration of that pool.

Virtual machines in a virtual machine pool are stateless, meaning that data is not persistent across reboots. However, if a user configures console options for a virtual machine taken from a virtual machine pool, those options will be set as the default for that user for that virtual machine pool.

In principle, virtual machines in a pool are started when taken by a user, and shut down when the user is finished. However, virtual machine pools can also contain pre-started virtual machines. Pre-started virtual machines are kept in an up state, and remain idle until they are taken by a user. This allows users to start using such virtual machines immediately, but these virtual machines will consume system resources even while not in use due to being idle.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Virtual machines taken from a pool are not stateless when accessed from the Administration Portal. This is because administrators need to be able to write changes to the disk if necessary.

</div>

### Virtual Machine Pool Tasks

#### Creating a Virtual Machine Pool

**Summary**

You can create a virtual machine pool that contains multiple virtual machines that have been created based on a common template.

**Procedure 10.1. Creating a Virtual Machine Pool**

1.  Click the **Pools** tab.
2.  Click the **New** button to open the **New Pool** window.
    -   Use the drop down-list to select the **Cluster** or use the selected default.
    -   Use the **Based on Template** drop-down menu to select a template or use the selected default. If you have selected a template, optionally use the **Template Sub Version** drop-down menu to select a version of that template. A template provides standard settings for all the virtual machines in the pool.
    -   Use the **Operating System** drop-down list to select an **Operating System** or use the default provided by the template.
    -   Use the **Optimized for** drop-down list to optimize virtual machines for either **Desktop** use or **Server** use.

3.  Enter a **Name** and **Description**, any **Comments** and the **Number of VMs** for the pool.
4.  Select the **Maximum number of VMs per user** that a single user is allowed to run in a session. The minimum is one.
5.  Optionally, click the **Show Advanced Options** button and perform the following steps:
    1.  Select the **Console** tab. At the bottom of the tab window, select the **Override SPICE Proxy** check box to enable the **Overridden SPICE proxy address** text field and specify the address of a SPICE proxy to override the global SPICE proxy, if any.
    2.  Click the **Pool** tab and select a **Pool Type**:
        -   **Manual** - The administrator is responsible for explicitly returning the virtual machine to the pool. The virtual machine reverts to the original base image after the administrator returns it to the pool.
        -   **Automatic** - When the virtual machine is shut down, it automatically reverts to its base image and is returned to the virtual machine pool.

6.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have created and configured a virtual machine pool with the specified number of identical virtual machines. You can view these virtual machines in the **Virtual Machines** resource tab, or in the details pane of the **Pools** resource tab; a virtual machine in a pool is distinguished from independent virtual machines by its icon.

#### Prestarting Virtual Machines in a Pool

The virtual machines in a virtual machine pool are powered down by default. When a user requests a virtual machine from a pool, a machine is powered up and assigned to the user. In contrast, a prestarted virtual machine is already running and waiting to be assigned to a user, decreasing the amount of time a user has to wait before being able to access a machine. When a prestarted virtual machine is shut down it is returned to the pool and restored to its original state. The maximum number of prestarted virtual machines is the number of virtual machines in the pool.

**Summary**

Prestarted virtual machines are suitable for environments in which users require immediate access to virtual machines which are not specifically assigned to them. Only automatic pools can have prestarted virtual machines.

⁠

**Procedure 10.3. Prestarting Virtual Machines in a Pool**

1.  Use the **Pools** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the virtual machine pool in the results list.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Pool** window.
3.  Enter the number of virtual machines to be prestarted in the **Prestarted VMs** field.
4.  Select the **Pool** tab. Ensure **Pool Type** is set to **Automatic**.
5.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have set a number of prestarted virtual machines in a pool. The prestarted machines are running and available for use.

#### Adding Virtual Machines to a Virtual Machine Pool

**Summary**

If you require more virtual machines than originally provisioned in a virtual machine pool, add more machines to the pool.

⁠

**Procedure 10.4. Adding Virtual Machines to a Virtual Machine Pool**

1.  Use the **Pools** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the virtual machine pool in the results list.
2.  Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Pool** window.
3.  Enter the number of additional virtual machines to add in the **Increase number of VMs in pool by** field.
4.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have added more virtual machines to the virtual machine pool.

#### Detaching Virtual Machines from a Virtual Machine Pool

**Summary**

You can detach virtual machines from a virtual machine pool. Detaching a virtual machine removes it from the pool to become an independent virtual machine.

⁠

**Procedure 10.5. Detaching Virtual Machines from a Virtual Machine Pool**

1.  Use the **Pools** resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the virtual machine pool in the results list.
2.  Ensure the virtual machine has a status of `Down` because you cannot detach a running virtual machine. Click the **Virtual Machines** tab in the details pane to list the virtual machines in the pool.
3.  Select one or more virtual machines and click **Detach** to open the **Detach Virtual Machine(s)** confirmation window.
4.  Click **OK** to detach the virtual machine from the pool.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** The virtual machine still exists in the environment and can be viewed and accessed from the **Virtual Machines** resource tab. Note that the icon changes to denote that the detached virtual machine is an independent virtual machine.

</div>
**Result**

You have detached a virtual machine from the virtual machine pool.

#### Removing a Virtual Machine Pool

**Summary**

You can remove a virtual machine pool from a data center. You must first either delete or detach all of the virtual machines in the pool. Detaching virtual machines from the pool will preserve them as independent virtual machines.

⁠

## ⁠Virtual Machine Disks

### Understanding Virtual Machine Storage

oVirt supports three storage types: NFS, iSCSI and FCP.

In each type, a host known as the Storage Pool Manager (SPM) manages access between hosts and storage. The SPM host is the only node that has full access within the storage pool; the SPM can modify the storage domain metadata, and the pool's metadata. All other hosts can only access virtual machine hard disk image data.

By default in an NFS, local, or POSIX compliant data center, the SPM creates the virtual disk using a thin provisioned format as a file in a file system.

In iSCSI and other block-based data centers, the SPM creates a volume group on top of the Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) provided, and makes logical volumes to use as virtual machine disks. Virtual machine disks on block-based storage are preallocated by default.

If the virtual disk is preallocated, a logical volume of the specified size in GB is created. The virtual machine can be mounted on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server using `kpartx`, `vgscan`, `vgchange` and `mount` to investigate the virtual machine's processes or problems.

If the virtual disk is a thin provisioned, a 1 GB logical volume is created. The logical volume is continuously monitored by the host on which the virtual machine is running. As soon as the usage nears a threshold the host notifies the SPM, and the SPM extends the logical volume by 1 GB. The host is responsible for resuming the virtual machine after the logical volume has been extended. If the virtual machine goes into a paused state it means that the SPM could not extend the disk in time. This occurs if the SPM is too busy or if there is not enough storage space.

A virtual disk with a preallocated (RAW) format has significantly faster write speeds than a virtual disk with a thin provisioning (Qcow2) format. Thin provisioning takes significantly less time to create a virtual disk. The thin provision format is suitable for non-IO intensive virtual machines.

oVirt 3.3 and above introduced online virtual drive resizing.

### Understanding Virtual Disks

Virtual disks are of two types, **Thin Provisioned** or **Preallocated**. Preallocated disks are RAW formatted. Thin provisioned disks are QCOW2 formatted.

*   Preallocated A preallocated virtual disk has reserved storage of the same size as the virtual disk itself. The backing storage device (file/block device) is presented as is to the virtual machine with no additional layering in between. This results in better performance because no storage allocation is required during runtime. On SAN (iSCSI, FCP) this is achieved by creating a block device with the same size as the virtual disk. On NFS this is achieved by filling the backing hard disk image file with zeros. Preallocating storage on an NFS storage domain presumes that the backing storage is not QCOW2 formatted and zeros will not be deduplicated in the hard disk image file. (If these assumptions are incorrect, do not select Preallocated for NFS virtual disks).
*   Thin Provisioned For sparse virtual disks backing storage is not reserved and is allocated as needed during runtime. This allows for storage overcommitment under the assumption that most disks are not fully utilized and that storage capacity can be utilized better. This requires the backing storage to monitor write requests and can cause some performance issues. On NFS backing storage is achieved by using files. On SAN this is achieved by creating a block device smaller than the virtual disk's defined size and communicating with the hypervisor to monitor necessary allocations. This does not require support from the underlying storage devices.

The possible combinations of storage types and formats are described in the following table.

### Shareable Disks in oVirt

Some applications require storage to be shared between servers. oVirt allows you to mark virtual machine hard disks as **shareable** and attach those disks to virtual machines. That way a single virtual disk can be used by multiple cluster-aware guests.

Shared disks are not to be used in every situation. For applications like clustered database servers, and other highly available services, shared disks are appropriate. Attaching a shared disk to multiple guests that are not cluster-aware is likely to cause data corruption because their reads and writes to the disk are not coordinated.

You cannot take a snapshot of a shared disk. Virtual disks that have snapshots taken of them cannot later be marked shareable.

You can mark a disk shareable either when you create it, or by editing the disk later.

### Read Only Disks in oVirt

Some applications require administrators to share data with read-only rights. oVirt allows you to mark virtual machine hard disks as **Read Only** and attach those disks to virtual machines. If a disk is marked **shareable**, you can add it to some virtual machines as read-only and to others as rewritable. That way, a single disk can be read by multiple cluster-aware guests, while an administrator maintains writing privileges.

Floating disks are always rewritable and cannot be marked read-only.

A disk cannot be switched from or to read-only while active.

You can mark a disk read-only either when you create it, or by editing the disk later.

### Virtual Disk Tasks

#### Creating Floating Virtual Disks

**Summary**

You can create a virtual disk that does not belong to any virtual machines. You can then attach this disk to a single virtual machine, or to multiple virtual machines if the disk is shareable.

**Procedure 11.1. Creating Floating Virtual Disks**

1.  Select the **Disks** resource tab.
2.  Click **Add** to open the **Add Virtual Disk** window.
    ![Add Virtual Disk Window](Add_Virtual_Disk.png "fig:Add Virtual Disk Window")
    **Figure 11.1. Add Virtual Disk Window**
3.  Use the radio buttons to specify whether the virtual disk will be an **Internal** or **External (Direct Lun)** disk.
4.  Enter the **Size(GB)**, **Alias**, and **Description** of the virtual disk.
5.  Use the drop-down menus to select the **Interface**, **Allocation Policy**, **Data Center**, and **Storage Domain** of the virtual disk.
6.  Select the **Wipe After Delete**, **Is Bootable** and **Is Shareable** check boxes to enable each of these options.
7.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have created a virtual disk that can be attached to one or more virtual machines depending on its settings.

Using LUNs directly as virtual machine hard disk images removes a layer of abstraction between your virtual machines and their data.

The following considerations must be made when using a direct LUN as a virtual machine hard disk image:

*   Live storage migration of direct LUN hard disk images is not supported.
*   Direct LUN disks are not included in virtual machine exports.
*   Direct LUN disks are not included in virtual machine snapshots.

## ⁠Backups

### Backing Up and Restoring oVirt

#### Backing up oVirt - Overview

While taking complete backups of the machine on which oVirt is installed is recommended whenever changing the configuration of that machine, a utility is provided for backing up only the key files related to oVirt. This utility - the `engine-backup` command - can be used to rapidly back up the engine database and configuration files into a single file that can be easily stored.

#### Syntax for the engine-backup Command

The `engine-backup` command works in one of two basic modes:

    # engine-backup --mode=backup

    # engine-backup --mode=restore

These two modes are further extended by a set of parameters that allow you to specify the scope of the backup and different credentials for the engine database. A full list of parameters and their function is as follows:

**Basic Options**

*`--mode`*  
Specifies whether the command will perform a backup operation or a restore operation. Two options are available - `backup`, and `restore`. This is a required parameter.

*`--file`*  
Specifies the path and name of a file into which backups are to be taken in backup mode, and the path and name of a file from which to read backup data in restore mode. This is a required parameter in both backup mode and restore mode.

*`--log`*  
Specifies the path and name of a file into which logs of the backup or restore operation are to be written. This parameter is required in both backup mode and restore mode.

*`--scope`*  
Specifies the scope of the backup or restore operation. There are two options - `all`, which backs up both the engine database and configuration data, and `db`, which backs up only the engine database.

**Database Options**

The following options are only available when using the `engine-backup` command in `restore` mode.

*`--change-db-credentials`*  
Allows you to specify alternate credentials for restoring the engine database using credentials other than those stored in the backup itself. Specifying this parameter allows you to add the following parameters.

*`--db-host`*  
Specifies the IP address or fully qualified domain name of the host on which the database resides. This is a required parameter.

*`--db-port`*  
Specifies the port by which a connection to the database will be made.

*`--db-user`*  
Specifies the name of the user by which a connection to the database will be made. This is a required parameter.

*`--db-passfile`*  
Specifies a file containing the password by which a connection to the database will be made. Either this parameter or the *`--db-password`* parameter must be specified.

*`--db-password`*  
Specifies the plain text password by which a connection to the database will be made. Either this parameter or the *`--db-passfile`* parameter must be specified.

*`--db-name`*  
Specifies the name of the database to which the database will be restored. This is a required parameter.

*`--db-secured`*  
Specifies that the connection with the database is to be secured.

*`--db-secured-validation`*  
Specifies that the connection with the host is to be validated.

**Help**

*`--help`*  
Provides an overview of the available modes, parameters, sample usage, how to create a new database and configure the firewall in conjunction with backing up and restoring oVirt.

#### Creating a Backup with the engine-backup Command

**Summary**

The process for creating a backup of the engine database and the configuration data for oVirt using the `engine-backup` command is straightforward and can be performed while oVirt is active.

**Procedure 12.1. Backing up oVirt**

1.  Log on to the machine running oVirt.
2.  Run the following command to create a full backup:
    **Example 12.1. Creating a Full Backup**
        # engine-backup --scope=all --mode=backup --log=[file name] --file=[file name]

    Alternatively, run the following command to back up only the engine database:
    **Example 12.2. Creating an engine database Backup**

        # engine-backup --scope=db --mode=backup --log=[file name] --file=[file name]

**Result**

A `tar` file containing a backup of the engine database, or the engine database and the configuration data for oVirt, is created using the path and file name provided.

#### Restoring a Backup with the engine-backup Command

While the process for restoring a backup using the `engine-backup` command is straightforward, it involves several additional steps in comparison to that for creating a backup depending on the destination to which the backup is to be restored. For example, the `engine-backup` command can be used to restore backups to fresh installations of oVirt, on top of existing installations of oVirt, and using local or remote databases.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Backups can only be restored to environments of the same major release as that of the backup. For example, a backup of an oVirt version 3.3 environment can only be restored to another oVirt version 3.3 environment. To view the version of oVirt contained in a backup file, unpack the backup file and read the value in the `version` file located in the root directory of the unpacked files.

</div>

#### Restoring a Backup to a Fresh Installation

**Summary**

The `engine-backup` command can be used to restore a backup to a fresh installation of oVirt. The following procedure must be performed on a machine on which the base operating system has been installed and the required packages for oVirt have been installed, but the `engine-setup` command has not yet been run. This procedure assumes that the backup file can be accessed from the machine on which the backup is to be restored.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** The `engine-backup` command does not handle the actual creation of the engine database or the initial configuration of the `postgresql` service. Therefore, these tasks must be performed manually as outlined below when restoring a backup to a fresh installation.

</div>
**Procedure 12.2. Restoring a Backup to a Fresh Installation**

1.  Log on to the machine on which oVirt is installed.
2.  Manually create an empty database to which the database in the backup can be restored and configure the `postgresql` service:
    1.  Run the following commands to initialize the `postgresql` database, start the `postgresql` service and ensure this service starts on boot:
            # service postgresql initdb
            # service postgresql start
            # chkconfig postgresql on

    2.  Run the following commands to enter the postgresql command line:
            # su postgres
            $ psql

    3.  Run the following command to create a new user:
            postgres=# create role [user name] with login encrypted password '[password]';

    4.  Run the following command to create the new database:
            postgres=# create database [database name] owner [user name] template template0 encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8' lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';

    5.  Edit the `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` file as follows:
        -   For local databases, replace the existing directives in the section starting with `Local` at the bottom of the file with the following directives:
                host    [database name]    [user name]    0.0.0.0/0  md5
                host    [database name]    [user name]    ::0/0      md5

        -   For remote databases, add the following line immediately underneath the line starting with `Local` at the bottom of the file, replacing *X.X.X.X* with the IP address of oVirt:
                host    [database name]    [user name]    X.X.X.X/32   md5

    6.  Run the following command to restart the `postgresql` service:
            # service postgresql restart

3.  Restore the backup using the `engine-backup` command with the *`--change-db-credentials`* parameter to pass the credentials of the new database:
        # engine-backup --mode=restore --file=[file name] --log=[file name] --change-db-credentials --db-host=[database location] --db-name=[database name] --db-user=[user name] --db-password=[password]

    If successful, the following output displays:

        You should now run engine-setup.
        Done.

4.  Run the following command and follow the prompts to configure oVirt:
        # engine-setup

**Result**

The engine database and configuration files for oVirt have been restored to the version in the backup.

#### Restoring a Backup to Overwrite an Existing Installation

**Summary**

The `engine-backup` command can restore a backup to a machine on which oVirt has already been installed and set up. This is useful when you have taken a backup up of an installation, performed changes on that installation and then want to restore the installation from the backup.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** When restoring a backup to overwrite an existing installation, you must run the `engine-cleanup` command to clean up the existing installation before using the `engine-backup` command. Because the `engine-backup` command only cleans the engine database, and does not drop the database or delete the user that owns that database, you do not need to create a new database or specify the database credentials because the user and database already exist.

</div>
**Procedure 12.3. Restoring a Backup to Overwrite an Existing Installation**

1.  Log on to the machine on which oVirt is installed.
2.  Run the following command and follow the prompts to remove the configuration files for and clean the database associated with oVirt:
        # engine-cleanup

3.  Restore the backup using the `engine-backup` command:
        # engine-backup --mode=restore --file=[file name] --log=[file name]

    If successful, the following output displays:

        You should now run engine-setup.
        Done.

4.  Run the following command and follow the prompts to re-configure the firewall and ensure the `ovirt-engine` service is correctly configured:
        # engine-setup

**Result**

The engine database and configuration files for oVirt have been restored to the version in the backup.

#### Restoring a Backup with Different Credentials

**Summary**

The `engine-backup` command can restore a backup to a machine on which oVirt has already been installed and set up, but the credentials of the database in the backup are different to those of the database on the machine on which the backup is to be restored. This is useful when you have taken a backup of an installation and want to restore the installation from the backup to a different system.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** When restoring a backup to overwrite an existing installation, you must run the `engine-cleanup` command to clean up the existing installation before using the `engine-backup` command. Because the `engine-backup` command only cleans the engine database, and does not drop the database or delete the user that owns that database, you do not need to create a new database or specify the database credentials because the user and database already exist. However, if the credentials for the owner of the engine database are not known, you must change them before you can restore the backup.

</div>
**Procedure 12.4. Restoring a Backup with Different Credentials**

1.  Log on to the machine on which oVirt is installed.
2.  Run the following command and follow the prompts to remove the configuration files for and clean the database associated with oVirt:
        # engine-cleanup

3.  Change the password for the owner of the engine database if the credentials of that user are not known:
    1.  Run the following commands to enter the postgresql command line:
            # su postgres
            $ psql

    2.  Run the following command to change the password of the user that owns the engine database:
            postgres=# alter role [user name] encrypted password '[new password]';

4.  Restore the backup using the `engine-backup` command with the *`--change-db-credentials`* parameter:
        # engine-backup --mode=restore --file=[file name] --log=[file name] --change-db-credentials --db-host=[database location] --db-name=[database name] --db-user=[user name] --db-password=[password]

    If successful, the following output displays:

        You should now run engine-setup.
        Done.

5.  Run the following command and follow the prompts to re-configure the firewall and ensure the `ovirt-engine` service is correctly configured:
        # engine-setup

**Result**

The engine database and configuration files for oVirt have been restored to the version in the backup using the supplied credentials, and oVirt has been configured to use the new database.

### Manually Backing Up and Restoring oVirt

#### Backing Up the Engine Database Using the backup.sh Script

**Summary**

oVirt includes a script to automate database backups. Using this script on your Manager server, you can protect yourself against potential data loss.

**Procedure 12.5. Backing up the engine database using the backup.sh script**

1.  Change into the `/usr/share/ovirt-engine/dbscripts/` directory.
2.  Invoke `backup.sh` with the *`-h`* parameter to see the available options.
        Usage: backup.sh [-h] [-s SERVERNAME] [-p PORT] [-d DATABASE] [-l DIR] -u USERNAME [-v] 

            -s SERVERNAME - The database servername for the database (def. localhost)
            -p PORT       - The database port for the database       (def. 5432)
            -d DATABASE   - The database name                        (def. engine)
            -u USERNAME   - The username for the database.
            -v            - Turn on verbosity (WARNING: lots of output)
            -l DIR        - Backup file directory. 
            -h            - This help text.

        for more options please run pg_dump --help

3.  Invoke the `backup.sh` command again with parameters appropriate for your environment. If you are backing up the local `engine` database, the *`-s, -p,`* and *`-d`* parameters are not necessary. Use the *`-l`* to specify the backup directory. This will cause a `.sql` file to be created in the directory you give.
4.  Copy the `.sql` you just created from the directory you specified to a safe remote location.

**Result**

You have used the backup.sh script to backup your `engine` database.

#### Backing Up Manager Configuration Files

oVirt stores customized configurations as configuration files. These configuration files contain specific configuration details regarding a given environment, and must be backed up.

**Table 12.1. Files and directories that must be backed up**

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="67%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left"><p>Location</p></th>
<th align="left"><p>Overview</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>/etc/ovirt-engine/</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>A directory containing information on deployments.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>/usr/share/ovirt-engine-reports/</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>A directory containing configuration files related to reports. In particular, this directory contains sub-directories in which the credentials of the reports user are stored in a plain text, human-readable format.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>/root/.rnd</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>A random seed file used to generate secure certificates.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>/var/log/ovirt-engine/setup/</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>A directory containing logs that contain the answers you gave to the setup configuration questions. You must use these files when restoring oVirt because they supply the same information that was used to initially configure oVirt.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When you have backed up all the above files and directories, you can recover oVirt to a working state after an unforeseen event.

#### Restoring the Engine Database Using the restore.sh Script

**Summary**

oVirt includes a script to automate database restoration. Using this script on your Manager server, you can recover from database corruption.

**Procedure 12.6. Restoring the Engine Database Using the restore.sh Script**

1.  Change into the `/usr/share/ovirt-engine/dbscripts/` directory.
2.  Invoke `restore.sh` with the *`-h`* parameter to see the available options.
        Usage: restore.sh [-h] [-s SERVERNAME] [-p PORT] -u USERNAME -d DATABASE -f FILE [-r] 

            -s SERVERNAME - The database servername for the database (def. localhost)
            -p PORT       - The database port for the database       (def. 5432)
            -u USERNAME   - The username for the database.
            -d DATABASE   - The database name
            -f File       - Backup file name to restore from. 
            -r            - Remove existing database with same name
            -h            - This help text.

        for more options please run pg_restore --help

3.  Invoke the `restore.sh` command again with parameters appropriate for your environment. If you are restoring the local `engine` database, the *`-s`* and *`-p`* parameters are not necessary. Use the *`-d`* to specify name of the database you are creating. oVirt expects a primary database named `engine`. Use the *`-f`* to specify the `.sql` file you are restoring from.

**Result**

You have used the restore.sh script to restore your `engine` database.

#### Restoring oVirt Configuration Files

**Summary**

Restore a backed up copy of configuration files to oVirt.

**Procedure 12.7. Restoring oVirt Configuration Files**

1.  Stop the engine service:
        # service ovirt-engine stop

2.  Completely remove all previous installations of oVirt:
        # yum remove ovirt-engine

3.  Remove `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine`:
        # rm -rf /etc/pki/ovirt-engine

4.  Remove the main `ovirt-engine` directory:
        # rm -rf /etc/ovirt-engine

5.  Install oVirt:
        # yum install -y ovirt-engine

6.  Run `engine-setup`, giving the same answers as when you originally installed `ovirt-engine`:
        # engine-setup

    Your answers can be found in `/var/log/engine-setup-SETUP-DATE.log`, which you backed up.

7.  Stop the engine service, which was restarted as a part of the previous command:
        # service ovirt-engine stop

8.  Restore the backed up configuration files to their original locations.
9.  Make sure the ownership of the `.truststore` file is correct:
        # chown ovirt:ovirt /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/.truststore

10. Make sure the permissions of the `ovirt-engine-notifier.conf` file is correct:
        # chmod 640 /usr/share/ovirt-engine/services/ovirt-engine-notifier/ovirt-engine-notifier.conf

11. Start the engine service:
        # service ovirt-engine start

**Result**

You have restored a backed up copy of configuration files to oVirt.

## ⁠Users and Roles

### Introduction to Users

oVirt uses external directory services for user authentication and information. All user accounts must be created in external directory servers; these users are called *directory users*. The exception is the `admin` user which resides in the `internal` domain created during installation.

After a directory server is attached to oVirt, the users in the directory can be added to the Administration Portal, making them *oVirt users*. oVirt users can be assigned different roles and permissions according to the tasks they have to perform.

There are two types of oVirt users - end users who use and manage virtual resources from the User Portal, and administrators who maintain the system infrastructure using the Administration Portal. `User` roles and `admin` roles can be assigned to oVirt users for individual resources like virtual machines and hosts, or on a hierarchy of objects like clusters and data centers.

### Directory Users

#### Directory Services Support in oVirt

During installation oVirt creates its own internal administration user, `admin`. This account is intended for use when initially configuring the environment, and for troubleshooting. To add other users to oVirt you must attach a directory server to oVirt using the Domain Management Tool, `engine-manage-domains`.

Once at least one directory server has been attached to oVirt, you can add users that exist in the directory server and assign roles to them using the Administration Portal. Users can be identified by their User Principal Name (UPN) of the form `user@domain`. Attachment of more than one directory server to oVirt is also supported.

The directory servers supported for use with oVirt 3.4 are:

*   Active Directory
*   Identity Management (IdM)
*   Red Hat Directory Server 9 (RHDS 9)
*   OpenLDAP

You must ensure that the correct DNS records exist for your directory server. In particular you must ensure that the DNS records for the directory server include:

*   A valid pointer record (PTR) for the directory server's reverse look-up address.
*   A valid service record (SRV) for LDAP over TCP port `389`.
*   A valid service record (SRV) for Kerberos over TCP port `88`.
*   A valid service record (SRV) for Kerberos over UDP port `88`.

If these records do not exist in DNS then you cannot add the domain to oVirt configuration using `engine-manage-domains`.

For more detailed information on installing and configuring a supported directory server, see the vendor's documentation:

*   Active Directory - [<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/dd448614>](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/dd448614).
*   Identity Management (IdM) - [<http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Identity_Management_Guide/index.html>](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Identity_Management_Guide/index.html)
*   Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) - [<http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/index.html>](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/index.html)
*   OpenLDAP - [<http://www.openldap.org/doc/>](http://www.openldap.org/doc/)

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** A user must be created in the directory server specifically for use as the oVirt administrative user. Do *not* use the administrative user for the directory server as the oVirt administrative user.

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** It is not possible to install oVirt (rhevm) and IdM (ipa-server) on the same system. IdM is incompatible with the mod_ssl package, which is required by oVirt.

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** If you are using Active Directory as your directory server, and you want to use `sysprep` in the creation of Templates and Virtual Machines, then the oVirt administrative user must be delegated control over the Domain to:

*   **Join a computer to the domain**
*   **Modify the membership of a group**

For information on creation of user accounts in Active Directory, see [<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732336.aspx>](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732336.aspx).

For information on delegation of control in Active Directory, see [<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732524.aspx>](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732524.aspx).

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** oVirt uses Kerberos to authenticate with directory servers. RHDS does not provide native support for Kerberos. If you are using RHDS as your directory server then you must ensure that the directory server is made a service within a valid Kerberos domain. To do this you must perform these steps while referring to the relevant directory server documentation:

*   Configure the `memberOf` plug-in for RHDS to allow group membership. In particular ensure that the value of the *`memberofgroupattr`* attribute of the `memberOf` plug-in is set to `uniqueMember`. In **OpenLDAP**, the `memberOf` functionality is not called a "plugin". It is called an "overlay" and requires no configuration after installation. Consult the Red Hat Directory Server 9.0 *Plug-in Guide* for more information on configuring the `memberOf` plug-in.
*   Define the directory server as a service of the form `ldap/hostname@REALMNAME` in the Kerberos realm. Replace *hostname* with the fully qualified domain name associated with the directory server and *REALMNAME* with the fully qualified Kerberos realm name. The Kerberos realm name must be specified in capital letters.
*   Generate a `keytab` file for the directory server in the Kerberos realm. The `keytab` file contains pairs of Kerberos principals and their associated encrypted keys. These keys allow the directory server to authenticate itself with the Kerberos realm. Consult the documentation for your Kerberos principle for more information on generating a `keytab` file.
*   Install the `keytab` file on the directory server. Then configure RHDS to recognize the `keytab` file and accept Kerberos authentication using GSSAPI. Consult the Red Hat Directory Server 9.0 *Administration Guide* for more information on configuring RHDS to use an external `keytab` file.
*   Test the configuration on the directory server by using the `kinit` command to authenticate as a user defined in the Kerberos realm. Once authenticated run the `ldapsearch` command against the directory server. Use the *`-Y GSSAPI`* parameters to ensure the use of Kerberos for authentication.

</div>

### User Authorization

#### User Authorization Model

oVirt applies authorization controls based on the combination of the three components:

*   The user performing the action
*   The type of action being performed
*   The object on which the action is being performed

#### User Actions

For an action to be successfully performed, the `user` must have the appropriate `permission` for the `object` being acted upon. Each type of action corresponds to a `permission`. There are many different permissions in the system, so for simplicity:

![Actions](Actions.png "Actions")

**Figure 13.1. Actions**

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Some actions are performed on more than one object. For example, copying a template to another storage domain will impact both the template and the destination storage domain. The user performing an action must have appropriate permissions for all objects the action impacts.

</div>

#### User Permissions

Permissions enable users to perform actions on objects, where objects are either individual objects or container objects.

![Permissions & Roles](Permissions roles.png "Permissions & Roles")

**Figure 13.2. Permissions & Roles**

Any permissions that apply to a container object also apply to all members of that container. The following diagram depicts the hierarchy of objects in the system.

![oVirt Object Hierarchy](Object heirarchy.png "oVirt Object Hierarchy")

**Figure 13.3. oVirt Object Hierarchy**

### oVirt User Properties and Roles

#### User Properties

Roles and permissions are the properties of the user. Roles are predefined sets of privileges that permit access to different levels of physical and virtual resources. Multilevel administration provides a finely grained hierarchy of permissions. For example, a data center administrator has permissions to manage all objects in the data center, while a host administrator has system administrator permissions to a single physical host. A user can have permissions to use a single virtual machine but not make any changes to the virtual machine configurations, while another user can be assigned system permissions to a virtual machine.

#### User and Administrator Roles

oVirt provides a range of pre-configured roles, from an administrator with system-wide permissions to an end user with access to a single virtual machine. While you cannot change or remove the default roles, you can clone and customize them, or create new roles according to your requirements. There are two types of roles:

*   Administrator Role: Allows access to the *Administration Portal* for managing physical and virtual resources. An administrator role does not confer any permissions for the User Portal.
*   User Role: Allows access to the *User Portal* for managing and accessing virtual machines and templates. A user role does not confer any permissions for the Administration Portal.

For example, if you have an `administrator` role on a cluster, you can manage all virtual machines in the cluster using the *Administration Portal*. However, you cannot access any of these virtual machines in the *User Portal*; this requires a `user` role.

#### User Roles Explained

The table below describes basic user roles which confer permissions to access and configure virtual machines in the User Portal.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** In oVirt 3.0, the **PowerUserRole** only granted permissions for virtual machines which are directly assigned to the PowerUser, or virtual machines created by the PowerUser. Now, the **VmCreator** role provides privileges previously conferred by the **PowerUserRole**. The **PowerUserRole** can now be applied on a system-wide level, or on specific data centers or clusters, and grants permissions to all virtual machines and templates within the system or specific resource. Having a **PowerUserRole** is equivalent to having the **VmCreator**, **DiskCreator**, and **TemplateCreator** roles.

**Procedure 13.2. Viewing User Information**

1.  Click the **Users** tab to display the list of authorized users.
2.  Select the user, or perform a search if the user is not visible on the results list.
3.  The details pane displays for the selected user, usually with the **General** tab displaying general information, such as the domain name, email and status of the user.
4.  The other tabs allow you to view groups, permissions, quotas, and events for the user. For example, to view the groups to which the user belongs, click the **Directory Groups** tab.

**Result**

You have viewed domain, permissions, quota, group and event information for a user.

#### Viewing User Permissions on Resources

**Summary**

Users can be assigned permissions on specific resources or a hierarchy of resources. You can view the assigned users and their permissions on each resource.

**Procedure 13.3. Viewing User Permissions on Resources**

1.  Use the resource tabs, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the resource in the results list.
2.  Click the **Permissions** tab of the details pane to list the assigned users, the user's role, and the inherited permissions for the selected resource.

**Result**

You have viewed the assigned users and their roles for a selected resource.

#### Removing Users

**Summary**

When a user account is no longer required, remove it from oVirt.

**Procedure 13.4. Removing Users**

1.  Click the **Users** tab to display the list of authorized users.
2.  Select the user to be removed. Ensure the user is not running any virtual machines.
3.  Click the **Remove** button. A message displays prompting you to confirm the removal. Click **OK**.

**Result**

The user is removed from oVirt, but not from the external directory.

#### Configuring Roles

Roles are predefined sets of privileges that can be configured from oVirt. Roles provide access and management permissions to different levels of resources in the data center, and to specific physical and virtual resources.

With multilevel administration, any permissions which apply to a container object also apply to all individual objects within that container. For example, when a host administrator role is assigned to a user on a specific host, the user gains permissions to perform any of the available host operations, but only on the assigned host. However, if the host administrator role is assigned to a user on a data center, the user gains permissions to perform host operations on all hosts within the cluster of the data center.

#### Creating a New Role

**Summary**

If the role you require is not on oVirt's default list of roles, you can create a new role and customize it to suit your purposes.

**Procedure 13.5. Creating a New Role**

1.  On the header bar, click the **Configure** button to open the **Configure** window. The window shows a list of default User and Administrator roles, and any custom roles.
2.  Click **New**. The **New Role** dialog box displays.

### User Role and Authorization Examples

The following examples illustrate how to apply authorization controls for various scenarios, using the different features of the authorization system described in this chapter.

**Example 13.1. Cluster Permissions**

Sarah is the system administrator for the accounts department of a company. All the virtual resources for her department are organized under an oVirt `cluster` called `Accounts`. She is assigned the `ClusterAdmin` role on the accounts cluster. This enables her to manage all virtual machines in the cluster, since the virtual machines are child objects of the cluster. Managing the virtual machines includes editing, adding, or removing virtual resources such as disks, and taking snapshots. It does not allow her to manage any resources outside this cluster. Because `ClusterAdmin` is an administrator role, it allows her to use the Administration Portal to manage these resources, but does not give her any access via the User Portal.

**Example 13.2. VM PowerUser Permissions**

John is a software developer in the accounts department. He uses virtual machines to build and test his software. Sarah has created a virtual desktop called `johndesktop` for him. John is assigned the `UserVmManager` role on the `johndesktop` virtual machine. This allows him to access this single virtual machine using the User Portal. Because he has `UserVmManager` permissions, he can modify the virtual machine and add resources to it, such as new virtual disks. Because `UserVmManager` is a user role, it does not allow him to use the Administration Portal.

⁠**Example 13.3. Data Center Power User Role Permissions**

Penelope is an office manager. In addition to her own responsibilities, she occasionally helps the HR manager with recruitment tasks, such as scheduling interviews and following up on reference checks. As per corporate policy, Penelope needs to use a particular application for recruitment tasks.

While Penelope has her own machine for office management tasks, she wants to create a separate virtual machine to run the recruitment application. She is assigned `PowerUserRole` permissions for the data center in which her new virtual machine will reside. This is because to create a new virtual machine, she needs to make changes to several components within the data center, including creating the virtual machine disk image in the storage domain.

Note that this is not the same as assigning `DataCenterAdmin` privileges to Penelope. As a PowerUser for a data center, Penelope can log in to the User Portal and perform virtual machine-specific actions on virtual machines within the data center. She cannot perform data center-level operations such as attaching hosts or storage to a data center.

**Example 13.4. Network Administrator Permissions**

Chris works as the network administrator in the IT department. Her day-to-day responsibilities include creating, manipulating, and removing networks in the department's oVirt environment. For her role, she requires administrative privileges on the resources and on the networks of each resource. For example, if Chris has `NetworkAdmin` privileges on the IT department's data center, she can add and remove networks in the data center, and attach and detach networks for all virtual machines belonging to the data center.

In addition to managing the networks of the company's virtualized infrastructure, Chris also has a junior network administrator reporting to her. The junior network administrator, Pat, is managing a smaller virtualized environment for the company's internal training department. Chris has assigned Pat `NetworkUser` permissions and `UserVmManager` permissions for the virtual machines used by the internal training department. With these permissions, Pat can perform simple administrative tasks such as adding network interfaces onto virtual machines in the Power User Portal. However, he does not have permissions to alter the networks for the hosts on which the virtual machines run, or the networks on the data center to which the virtual machines belong.

**Example 13.5. Custom Role Permissions**

Rachel works in the IT department, and is responsible for managing user accounts in oVirt. She needs permission to add user accounts and assign them the appropriate roles and permissions. She does not use any virtual machines herself, and should not have access to administration of hosts, virtual machines, clusters or data centers. There is no built-in role which provides her with this specific set of permissions. A custom role must be created to define the set of permissions appropriate to Rachel's positi

![UserManager Custom Role](UserManager.png "UserManager Custom Role")

**Figure 13.6. UserManager Custom Role**

The **UserManager** custom role shown above allows manipulation of users, permissions and roles. These actions are organized under `System` - the top level object of the hierarchy shown in Figure 13.6. This means they apply to all other objects in the system. The role is set to have an **Account Type** of **Admin**. This means that when she is assigned this role, Rachel can only use the Administration Portal, not the User Portal.

## ⁠Quotas and Service Level Agreement Policy

### Introduction to Quota

Quota is a resource limitation tool provided with oVirt. Quota may be thought of as a layer of limitations on top of the layer of limitations set by User Permissions.

Quota is a data center object.

Quota allows administrators of oVirt environments to limit user access to memory, CPU, and storage. Quota defines the memory resources and storage resources an administrator can assign users. As a result users may draw on only the resources assigned to them. When the quota resources are exhausted, oVirt does not permit further user actions.

There are two different kinds of Quota:

**Table 14.1. The Two Different Kinds of Quota**

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left"><p>Quota type</p></th>
<th align="left"><p>Definition</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Run-time Quota</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This quota limits the consumption of runtime resources, like CPU and memory.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>Storage Quota</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This quota limits the amount of storage available.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Quota, like SELinux, has three modes:

**Table 14.2. Quota Modes**

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left"><p>Quota Mode</p></th>
<th align="left"><p>Function</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Enforced</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This mode puts into effect the Quota that you have set in audit mode, limiting resources to the group or user affected by the quota.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>Audit</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This mode allows you to change Quota settings. Choose this mode to increase or decrease the amount of runtime quota and the amount of storage quota available to users affected by it.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Disabled</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This mode turns off the runtime and storage limitations defined by the quota.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When a user attempts to run a virtual machine, the specifications of the virtual machine are compared to the storage allowance and the runtime allowance set in the applicable quota.

If starting a virtual machine causes the aggregated resources of all running virtual machines covered by a quota to exceed the allowance defined in the quota, then oVirt refuses to run the virtual machine.

When a user creates a new disk, the requested disk size is added to the aggregated disk usage of all the other disks covered by the applicable quota. If the new disk takes the total aggregated disk usage above the amount allowed by the quota, disk creation fails.

Quota allows for resource sharing of the same hardware. It supports hard and soft thresholds. Administrators can use a quota to set thresholds on resources. These thresholds appear, from the user's point of view, as 100% usage of that resource. To prevent failures when the customer unexpectedly exceeds this threshold, the interface supports a "grace" amount by which the threshold can be briefly exceeded. Exceeding the threshold results in a warning sent to the customer.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Quota imposes limitations upon the running of virtual machines. Ignoring these limitations is likely to result in a situation in which you cannot use your virtual machines and virtual disks.

</div>
When quota is running in enforced mode, virtual machines and disks that do not have quotas assigned cannot be used.

To power on a virtual machine, a quota must be assigned to that virtual machine.

To create a snapshot of a virtual machine, the disk associated with the virtual machine must have a quota assigned.

When creating a template from a virtual machine, you are prompted to select the quota that you want the template to consume. This allows you to set the template (and all future machines created from the template) to consume a different quota than the virtual machine and disk from which the template is generated.

### Shared Quota and Individually Defined Quota

Users with SuperUser permissions can create quotas for individual users or quotas for groups.

Group quotas can be set for Active Directory users. If a group of ten users are given a quota of 1TB of storage and one of the ten users fills the entire terabyte, then the entire group will be in excess of the quota and none of the ten users will be able to use any of the storage associated with their group.

An individual user's quota is set for only the individual. Once the individual user has used up all of his or her storage or runtime quota, the user will be in excess of the quota and the user will no longer be able to use the storage associated with his or her quota.

### Quota Accounting

When a quota is assigned to a consumer or a resource, each action by that consumer or on the resource involving storage, vCPU, or memory results in quota consumption or quota release.

Since the quota acts as an upper bound that limits the user's access to resources, the quota calculations may differ from the actual current use of the user. The quota is calculated for the max growth potential and not the current usage.

**Example 14.1. Accounting example**

A user runs a virtual machine with 1 vCPU and 1024 MB memory. The action consumes 1 vCPU and 1024 MB of the quota assigned to that user. When the virtual machine is stopped 1 vCPU and 1024 MB of RAM are released back to the quota assigned to that user. Run-time quota consumption is accounted for only during the actual run-time of the consumer.

A user creates a virtual thin provision disk of 10GB. The actual disk usage may indicate only 3GB of that disk are actually in use. The quota consumption, however, would be 10GB, the max growth potential of that disk.

### Enabling and Changing a Quota Mode in a Data Center

**Summary**

This procedure enables or changes the quota mode in a data center. You must select a quota mode before you can define quotas. You must be logged in to the Web Administration Portal to follow the steps of this procedure.

Use **Audit** mode to test your quota to make sure it works as you expect it to. You do not need to have your quota in **Audit** mode to create or change a quota.

**Procedure 14.1. Enabling and Changing Quota in a Data Center**

7.  Click **Edit** on the bottom-right of the **Memory & CPU** field. An **Edit Quota** window opens.
8.  Under the **Memory** field, select either the **Unlimited** radio button (to allow limitless use of Memory resources in the cluster), or select the **limit to** radio button to set the amount of memory set by this quota. If you select the **limit to** radio button, input a memory quota in megabytes (MB) in the **MB** field.
9.  Under the **CPU** field, select either the **Unlimited** radio button or the **limit to** radio button to set the amount of CPU set by this quota. If you select the **limit to** radio button, input a number of vCPUs in the **vCpus** field.
10. Click **OK** in the **Edit Quota** window.
11. In the **Storage** section of the **New Quota** window, use the green slider to set **Storage Threshold**.
12. In the **Storage** section of the **New Quota** window, use the blue slider to set **Storage Grace**.
13. Click **Edit** in the **Storage** field. The **Edit Quota** window opens.
14. Under the **Storage Quota** field, select either the **Unlimited** radio button (to allow limitless use of Storage) or the **limit to** radio button to set the amount of storage to which quota will limit users. If you select the **limit to** radio button, input a storage quota size in gigabytes (GB) in the **GB** field.
15. Click **OK** in the **Edit Quota** window. You are returned to the **New Quota** window.
16. Click **OK** in the **New Quota** window.

**Result**

You have created a new quota policy.

### Explanation of Quota Threshold Settings

**Table 14.3. Quota thresholds and grace**

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left"><p>Setting</p></th>
<th align="left"><p>Definition</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Cluster Threshold</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The amount of cluster resources available per data center.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>The amount of storage available for the data center after exhausting the data center's Storage Threshold.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If a quota is set to 100GB with 20% Grace, then consumers are blocked from using storage after they use 120GB of storage. If the same quota has a Threshold set at 70%, then consumers receive a warning when they exceed 70GB of storage consumption (but they remain able to consume storage until they reach 120GB of storage consumption.) Both "Threshold" and "Grace" are set relative to the quota. "Threshold" may be thought of as the "soft limit", and exceeding it generates a warning. "Grace" may be thought of as the "hard limit", and exceeding it makes it impossible to consume any more storage resources.

### Assigning a Quota to an Object

**Summary**

**Summary**

This procedure explains how to associate a virtual machine disk with a quota.

**Procedure 14.4. Assigning a Quota to a Virtual Disk**

1.  In the navigation pane, select the Virtual Machine whose disk(s) you plan to add a quota.
2.  In the details pane, select the disk you plan to associate with a quota.
3.  Click **Edit**. The **Edit Virtual Disk** window appears.
4.  Select the quota you want the virtual disk to consume.
5.  Click **OK**.

**Result**

You have designated a quota for the virtual disk you selected.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Important:** Quota must be selected for all objects associated with a virtual machine, in order for that virtual machine to work. If you fail to select a quota for the objects associated with a virtual machine, the virtual machine will not work. The error that oVirt throws in this situation is generic, which makes it difficult to know if the error was thrown because you did not associate a quota with all of the objects associated with the virtual machine. It is not possible to take snapshots of virtual machines that do not have an assigned quota. It is not possible to create templates of virtual machines whose virtual disks do not have assigned quotas.

</div>

### The oVirt Engine Rename Tool

#### The oVirt Engine Rename Tool

When the `engine-setup` command is run in a clean environment, the command generates a number of certificates and keys that use the fully qualified domain name of oVirt supplied during the setup process. If the fully qualified domain name of oVirt must be changed later on (for example, due to migration of the machine hosting oVirt to a different domain), the records of the fully qualified domain name must be updated to reflect the new name. The `ovirt-engine-rename` command automates this task.

The `ovirt-engine-rename` command updates records of the fully qualified domain name of oVirt in the following locations:

*   /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/10-setup-protocols.conf
*   /etc/ovirt-engine/imageuploader.conf.d/10-engine-setup.conf
*   /etc/ovirt-engine/isouploader.conf.d/10-engine-setup.conf
*   /etc/ovirt-engine/logcollector.conf.d/10-engine-setup.conf
*   /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/cert.conf
*   /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/cert.template
*   /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/certs/apache.cer
*   /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/apache.key.nopass
*   /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/apache.p12

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Warning:** While the `ovirt-engine-rename` command creates a new certificate for the web server on which oVirt runs, it does not affect the certificate for the engine or the certificate authority. Due to this, there is some risk involved in using the `ovirt-engine-rename` command, particularly in environments that have been upgraded from oVirt version 3.2 and earlier. Therefore, changing the fully qualified domain name of oVirt by running `engine-cleanup` and `engine-setup` is recommended where possible.

</div>

#### Syntax for the oVirt Engine Rename Command

The basic syntax for the `ovirt-engine-rename` command is:

    # /usr/share/ovirt-engine/setup/bin/ovirt-engine-rename

The command also accepts the following options:

*`--newname=[new name]`*  
Allows you to specify the new fully qualified domain name for oVirt without user interaction.

*`--log=[file]`*  
Allows you to specify the path and name of a file into which logs of the rename operation are to be written.

*`--config=[file]`*  
Allows you to specify the path and file name of a configuration file to load into the rename operation.

*`--config-append=[file]`*  
Allows you to specify the path and file name of a configuration file to append to the rename operation. This option can be used to specify the path and file name of an answer file.

*`--generate-answer=[file]`*  
Allows you to specify the path and file name of a file into which your answers to and the values changed by the `ovirt-engine-rename` command are recorded.

#### Using the oVirt Engine Rename Tool

**Summary**

You can use the `ovirt-engine-rename` command to update records of the fully qualified domain name of oVirt.

**Procedure 16.1. Renaming oVirt**

1.  Prepare all DNS and other relevant records for the new fully qualified domain name.
2.  Update the DHCP server configuration if DHCP is used.
3.  Update the host name on oVirt.
4.  Run the following command:
        # /usr/share/ovirt-engine/setup/bin/ovirt-engine-rename

5.  When prompted, press **Enter** to stop the engine service:
        During execution engine service will be stopped (OK, Cancel) [OK]:

6.  When prompted, enter the new fully qualified domain name for oVirt:
        New fully qualified server name:[new name]

**Result**

The `ovirt-engine-rename` command updates records of the fully qualified domain name of oVirt.

### The Domain Management Tool

#### The Domain Management Tool

oVirt authenticates users using directory services. To add users to oVirt you must first use the internal `admin` user to add the directory service that the users must be authenticated against. You add and remove directory services domains using the included domain management tool, `engine-manage-domains`.

The `engine-manage-domains` command is only accessible on the machine on which oVirt is installed. The `engine-manage-domains` command must be run as the `root` user.

#### Syntax for the Domain Management Tool

The usage syntax is:

    engine-manage-domains -action=ACTION [options]

Available actions are:

*`add`*  
Add a domain to oVirt's directory services configuration.

*`edit`*  
Edit a domain in oVirt's directory services configuration.

*`delete`*  
Delete a domain from oVirt's directory services configuration.

*`validate`*  
Validate oVirt's directory services configuration. This command attempts to authenticate each domain in the configuration using the configured user name and password.

*`list`*  
List oVirt's current directory services configuration.

These options can be combined with the actions on the command line:

*`--add-permissions`*  
Specifies that the domain user will be given the **SuperUser** role in oVirt. By default, if the *`--add-permissions`* parameter is not specified, the **SuperUser** role is not assigned to the domain user. The *`--add-permissions`* option is optional. It is only valid when used in combination with the *`add`* and *`edit`* actions.

*`--change-password-msg=[MSG]`*  
Specifies the message that is returned to the user at login when their password has expired. This allows you to direct users to a specific URL (must begin with http or https) where their password can be changed. The *`--change-password-msg`* option is optional, and is only valid when used in combination with the *`add`* and *`edit`* actions.

*`--config-file=[FILE]`*  
Specifies an alternate configuration file that the command must use. The *`--config-file`* parameter is always optional.

*`--domain=[DOMAIN]`*  
The domain on which the action will be performed. The *`--domain`* parameter is mandatory for the *`add`*, *`edit`*, and *`delete`* actions.

*`--force`*  
Forces the command to skip confirmation of delete operations.

*`--ldap-servers=[servers]`*  
A comma delimited list of LDAP servers to be set to the domain.

*`--provider=`*[PROVIDER]  
The LDAP provider type of the directory server for the domain. Valid values are:

*   *`ad`* - Microsoft Active Directory.
*   *`ipa`* - Identity Management (IdM).
*   *`rhds`* - Red Hat Directory Server. Red Hat Directory Server does not come with Kerberos. oVirt requires Kerberos authentication. Red Hat Directory Server must be running as a service inside a Kerberos domain to provide directory services to oVirt.
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Note:** To use Red Hat Directory Server as your directory server, you must have the `memberof` plug-in installed in Red Hat Directory Server. To use the `memberof` plug-in, your users must be `inetuser`.

    </div>
*   `itds` - IBM Tivoli Directory Server.
*   `oldap` - OpenLDAP.

*`--report`*  
When used in conjunction with the *`validate`* action, this command outputs a report of all validation errors encountered.

*`--user=[USER]`*  
Specifies the domain user to use. The *`--user`* parameter is mandatory for *`add`*, and optional for *`edit`*.

*`--password-file=[FILE]`*  
Specifies that the domain user's password is on the first line of the provided file. This option, or the *`--interactive`* option, must be used to provide the password for use with the *`add`* action.

For further details on usage, see the `engine-manage-domains` command's help output:

    # engine-manage-domains --help

### The Configuration Tool

#### The Configuration Tool

Installing oVirt modifies only a subset of configuration settings from their defaults. Further modifications are made using the configuration tool: `engine-config`.

The configuration tool does not require Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or oVirt to be running to update the configuration. Configuration key values are stored in the database; configuration changes will not be saved unless the database is operational. Changes are applied when Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is restarted.

oVirt stores configuration settings as a series of key-to-value pair mappings. The configuration tool allows you to:

*   List all available configuration keys.
*   List all available configuration values.
*   Retrieve the value of a specific configuration key.
*   Set the value of a specific configuration key.

You are also able to maintain multiple versions of oVirt's configuration with the configuration tool. Use the *`--cver`* parameter to specify the configuration version to be used when retrieving or setting a value for a configuration key. The default configuration version is `general`.

#### Syntax for engine-config Command

The configuration tool is accessible on the client machine on which oVirt is installed. For full usage information consult the help output of the `engine-config` command:

    # engine-config --help

**Common tasks**

List available configuration keys  
Use the *`--list`* parameter to list available configuration keys.

<!-- -->

    # engine-config --list

Each available configuration key is listed by name and description.

List available configuration values  
Use the *`--all`* parameter to list available configuration values.

<!-- -->

    # engine-config --all

Each available configuration key is listed by name, current value of the key, and the configuration version.

Retrieve value of configuration key  
Use the *`--get`* parameter to retrieve the value of a specific key.

<!-- -->

    # engine-config --get KEY_NAME

Replace *KEY_NAME* with the name of the specific key to retrieve the key name, value, and the configuration version. Use the *`--cver`* parameter to specify the configuration version of the value to be retrieved.

Set value of configuration key  
Use the *`--set`* parameter to set the value of a specific key. You must also set the configuration version to which the change is to apply using the *`--cver`* parameter.

<!-- -->

    # engine-config --set KEY_NAME=KEY_VALUE --cver=VERSION

Replace *KEY_NAME* with the name of the specific key to set; replace *KEY_VALUE* with the value to be set. Environments with more than one configuration version require the *VERSION* to be specified.

#### The admin@internal User

The `admin@internal` user account is automatically created upon installation of oVirt. This account is stored locally in oVirt's PostgreSQL database, separate from external directory services such as IdM or Active Directory. Unlike external directory domains, users cannot be added or deleted from the `internal` domain. The `admin@internal` user is the SuperUser of oVirt and has administrative privileges over the environment via the Administration Portal.

The password for the `admin@internal` user is set during the installation of oVirt. Use the **engine-config** utility if you need to reset the password.

#### Changing the Password for admin@internal

1.  Log in to oVirt server as the `root` user.
2.  -   For oVirt 3.6 or newer (for more info see [this](Features/AAA_JDBC#Password_management) link):
            # ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool user password-reset admin

    -   For oVirt 3.5 or later:
        Use the `engine-config` utility to set a new password for the `admin@internal` user.
            # engine-config -s AdminPassword=interactive

        Use escape characters if your password includes any special characters.

3.  Restart the ovirt-engine service for the changes to take effect.

<!-- -->

    # service ovirt-engine restart

### The Image Uploader Tool

#### The Image Uploader Tool

The `engine-image-uploader` command allows you to list export storage domains and upload virtual machine images in OVF format to an export storage domain and have them automatically recognized in oVirt.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** The image uploader only supports gzip-compressed OVF files created by oVirt.

</div>
The archive contains images and master directories in the following format:

    |-- images
    |   |-- [Image Group UUID]
    |        |--- [Image UUID (this is the disk image)]
    |        |--- [Image UUID (this is the disk image)].meta
    |-- master
    |   |---vms
    |       |--- [UUID]
    |             |--- [UUID].ovf

#### Syntax for the engine-image-uploader Command

The basic syntax for the image uploader command is:

    engine-image-uploader [options] list
    engine-image-uploader [options] upload [file].[file]...[file]

The image uploader command supports two actions - *`list`*, and *`upload`*.

*   The *`list`* action lists the export storage domains to which images can be uploaded.
*   The *`upload`* action uploads images to the specified export storage domain.

You must specify one of the above actions when you use the image uploader command. Moreover, you must specify at least one local file to use the *`upload`* action.

There are several parameters to further refine the `engine-image-uploader` command. You can set defaults for any of these parameters in the `/etc/ovirt-engine/imageuploader.conf` file.

**General Options**

*`-h`*, *`--help`*  
Displays information on how to use the image uploader command.

*`--conf-file=[PATH]`*  
Sets *[PATH]* as the configuration file the command will to use. The default is `etc/ovirt-engine/imageuploader.conf`.

*`--log-file=[PATH]`*  
Sets *[PATH]* as the specific file name the command will use to write log output. The default is `/var/log/ovirt-engine/ovirt-image-uploader/ovirt-image-uploader-[date].log`.

*`--cert-file=[PATH]`*  
Sets *[PATH]* as the certificate for validating the engine. The default is `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem`.

*`--insecure`*  
Specifies that no attempt will be made to verify the engine.

*`--quiet`*  
Sets quiet mode, reducing console output to a minimum.

*`-v`*, *`--verbose`*  
Sets verbose mode, providing more console output.

*`-f`*, *`--force`*  
Force mode is necessary when the source file being uploaded has the same file name as an existing file in the destination export domain. This option forces the existing file to be overwritten.

**oVirt Options**

*`-u [USER]`*, *`--user=[USER]`*  
Specifies the user whose credentials will be used to execute the command. The *[USER]* is specified in the format *[username]*@*[domain]*. The user must exist in the specified domain and be known to oVirt.

*`-r [FQDN]`*, *`--engine=[FQDN]`*  
Specifies the IP address or fully qualified domain name of oVirt from which the images will be uploaded. It is assumed that the image uploader is being run from the same machine on which oVirt is installed. The default value is `localhost:443`.

**Export Storage Domain Options**

The following options specify the export domain to which the images will be uploaded. These options cannot be used together; you must used either the *`-e`* option or the *`-n`* option.

*`-e`* *[EXPORT_DOMAIN]*, *`--export-domain=[EXPORT_DOMAIN]`*  
Sets the storage domain *EXPORT_DOMAIN* as the destination for uploads.

*`-n`* *[NFSSERVER]*, *`--nfs-server=[NFSSERVER]`*  
Sets the NFS path *[NFSSERVER]* as the destination for uploads.

**Import Options**

The following options allow you to customize which attributes of the images being uploaded are included when the image is uploaded to the export domain.

*`-i`*, *`--ovf-id`*  
Specifies that the UUID of the image will not be updated. By default, the command generates a new UUID for images that are uploaded. This ensures there is no conflict between the id of the image being uploaded and the images already in the environment.

*`-d`*, *`--disk-instance-id`*  
Specifies that the instance ID for each disk in the image will not be renamed. By default, the command generates new UUIDs for disks in images that are uploaded. This ensures there are no conflicts between the disks on the image being uploaded and the disks already in the environment.

*`-m`*, *`--mac-address`*  
Specifies that network components in the image will not be removed from the image. By default, the command removes network interface cards from image being uploaded to prevent conflicts with network cards on other virtual machines already in the environment. If you do not use this option, you can use the Administration Portal to add network interface cards to newly imported images and oVirt will ensure there are no MAC address conflicts.

*`-N [NEW_IMAGE_NAME]`*, *`--name=[NEW_IMAGE_NAME]`*  
Specifies a new name for the image being uploaded.

#### Creating an OVF Archive That is Compatible With the Image Uploader

**Summary**

You can create files that can be uploaded using the `engine-image-uploader` tool.

**Procedure 16.2. Creating an OVF Archive That is Compatible With the Image Uploader**

1.  Use oVirt to create an empty export domain. An empty export domain makes it easy to see which directory contains your virtual machine.
2.  Export your virtual machine to the empty export domain you just created.
3.  Log in to the storage server that serves as the export domain, find the root of the NFS share and change to the subdirectory under that mount point. You started with a new export domain, there is only one directory under the exported directory. It contains the `images/` and `master/` directories.
4.  Run the `tar -zcvf my.ovf images/ master/` command to create the tar/gzip ovf archive.
5.  Anyone you give the resulting ovf file to (in this example, called `my.ovf`) can import it to oVirt using the `engine-image-uploader` command.

**Result**

You have created a compressed OVF image file that can be distributed. Anyone you give it to can use the `engine-image-uploader` command to upload your image into their oVirt environment.

#### Basic engine-image-uploader Usage Examples

The following is an example of how to use the engine uploader command to list export storage domains:

**Example 16.1. Listing export storage domains using the image uploader**

    # engine-image-uploader list
    Please provide the REST API password for the admin@internal oVirt Engine user (CTRL+D to abort):
    Export Storage Domain Name | Datacenter  | Export Domain Status
    myexportdom               | Myowndc 　  | active

The following is an example of how to upload an Open Virtualization Format (ovf) file:

**Example 16.2. Uploading a file using the image uploader**

    # engine-image-uploader -e myexportdom upload myrhel6.ovf
    Please provide the REST API password for the admin@internal oVirt Engine user (CTRL+D to abort):

### The Log Collector Tool

#### Log Collector

A log collection tool is included in oVirt. This allows you to easily collect relevant logs from across the oVirt environment when requesting support.

The log collection command is `engine-log-collector`. You are required to log in as the `root` user and provide the administration credentials for the oVirt environment. The `engine-log-collector -h` command displays usage information, including a list of all valid options for the `engine-log-collector` command.

#### Syntax for engine-log-collector Command

The basic syntax for the log collector command is:

    engine-log-collector [options] list [all, clusters, datacenters]
    engine-log-collector [options] collect

The two supported modes of operation are *`list`* and *`collect`*.

*   The *`list`* parameter lists either the hosts, clusters, or data centers attached to oVirt. You are able to filter the log collection based on the listed objects.
*   The *`collect`* parameter performs log collection from oVirt. The collected logs are placed in an archive file under the `/tmp/logcollector` directory. The `engine-log-collector` command assigns each log a specific file name.

Unless another parameter is specified, the default action is to list the available hosts together with the data center and cluster to which they belong. You will be prompted to enter user names and passwords to retrieve certain logs.

There are numerous parameters to further refine the `engine-log-collector` command.

**General options**

*`--version`*  
Displays the version number of the command in use and returns to prompt.

*`-h`*, *`--help`*  
Displays command usage information and returns to prompt.

*`--conf-file=PATH`*  
Sets *PATH* as the configuration file the tool is to use.

*`--local-tmp=PATH`*  
Sets *PATH* as the directory in which logs are saved. The default directory is `/tmp/logcollector`.

*`--ticket-number=TICKET`*  
Sets *TICKET* as the ticket, or case number, to associate with the SOS report.

*`--upload=FTP_SERVER`*  
Sets *FTP_SERVER* as the destination for retrieved logs to be sent using FTP. Do not use this option unless advised to by a Red Hat support representative.

*`--log-file=PATH`*  
Sets *PATH* as the specific file name the command should use for the log output.

*`--quiet`*  
Sets quiet mode, reducing console output to a minimum. Quiet mode is off by default.

*`-v`*, *`--verbose`*  
Sets verbose mode, providing more console output. Verbose mode is off by default.

**oVirt Options**

These options filter the log collection and specify authentication details for oVirt.

These parameters can be combined for specific commands. For example, `engine-log-collector --user=admin@internal --cluster ClusterA,ClusterB --hosts "SalesHost"*` specifies the user as `admin@internal` and limits the log collection to only `SalesHost` hosts in clusters `A` and `B`.

*`--no-hypervisors`*  
Omits virtualization hosts from the log collection.

*`-u USER`*, *`--user=USER`*  
Sets the user name for login. The *USER* is specified in the format *user*@*domain*, where *user* is the user name and *domain* is the directory services domain in use. The user must exist in directory services and be known to oVirt.

*`-r FQDN`*, *`--rhevm=FQDN`*  
Sets the fully qualified domain name of oVirt server from which to collect logs, where *FQDN* is replaced by the fully qualified domain name of oVirt. It is assumed that the log collector is being run on the same local host as oVirt; the default value is `localhost`.

*`-c CLUSTER`*, *`--cluster=CLUSTER`*  
Collects logs from the virtualization hosts in the nominated *CLUSTER* in addition to logs from oVirt. The cluster(s) for inclusion must be specified in a comma-separated list of cluster names or match patterns.

*`-d DATACENTER`*, *`--data-center=DATACENTER`*  
Collects logs from the virtualization hosts in the nominated *DATACENTER* in addition to logs from oVirt. The data center(s) for inclusion must be specified in a comma-separated list of data center names or match patterns.

*`-H HOSTS_LIST`*, *`--hosts=HOSTS_LIST`*  
Collects logs from the virtualization hosts in the nominated *HOSTS_LIST* in addition to logs from oVirt. The hosts for inclusion must be specified in a comma-separated list of host names, fully qualified domain names, or IP addresses. Match patterns are also valid.

**SOS Report Options**

The log collector uses the JBoss SOS plugin. Use the following options to activate data collection from the JMX console.

*`--jboss-home=JBOSS_HOME`*  
JBoss installation directory path. The default is `/var/lib/jbossas`.

*`--java-home=JAVA_HOME`*  
Java installation directory path. The default is `/usr/lib/jvm/java`.

*`--jboss-profile=JBOSS_PROFILE`*  
Displays a quoted and space-separated list of server profiles; limits log collection to specified profiles. The default is *`'rhevm-slimmed'`*.

*`--enable-jmx`*  
Enables the collection of run-time metrics from oVirt's JBoss JMX interface.

*`--jboss-user=JBOSS_USER`*  
User with permissions to invoke JBoss JMX. The default is *`admin`*.

*`--jboss-logsize=LOG_SIZE`*  
Maximum size in MB for the retrieved log files.

*`--jboss-stdjar=STATE`*  
Sets collection of JAR statistics for JBoss standard JARs. Replace *STATE* with `on` or `off`. The default is `on`.

*`--jboss-servjar=STATE`*  
Sets collection of JAR statistics from any server configuration directories. Replace *STATE* with `on` or `off`. The default is `on`.

*`--jboss-twiddle=STATE`*  
Sets collection of twiddle data on or off. Twiddle is the JBoss tool used to collect data from the JMX invoker. Replace *STATE* with `on` or `off`. The default is `on`.

*`--jboss-appxml=XML_LIST`*  
Displays a quoted and space-separated list of applications with XML descriptions to be retrieved. Default is `all`.

**SSH Configuration**

*`--ssh-port=PORT`*  
Sets *PORT* as the port to use for SSH connections with virtualization hosts.

*`-k KEYFILE`*, *`--key-file=KEYFILE`*  
Sets *KEYFILE* as the public SSH key to be used for accessing the virtualization hosts.

*`--max-connections=MAX_CONNECTIONS`*  
Sets *MAX_CONNECTIONS* as the maximum concurrent SSH connections for logs from virtualization hosts. The default is `10`.

**PostgreSQL Database Options**

The database user name and database name must be specified, using the *`pg-user`* and *`dbname`* parameters, if they have been changed from the default values.

Use the *`pg-dbhost`* parameter if the database is not on the local host. Use the optional *`pg-host-key`* parameter to collect remote logs. The PostgreSQL SOS plugin must be installed on the database server for remote log collection to be successful.

*`--no-postgresql`*  
Disables collection of database. The log collector will connect to oVirt PostgreSQL database and include the data in the log report unless the *`--no-postgresql`* parameter is specified.

*`--pg-user=USER`*  
Sets *USER* as the user name to use for connections with the database server. The default is `postgres`.

*`--pg-dbname=DBNAME`*  
Sets *DBNAME* as the database name to use for connections with the database server. The default is `rhevm`.

*`--pg-dbhost=DBHOST`*  
Sets *DBHOST* as the host name for the database server. The default is `localhost`.

*`--pg-host-key=KEYFILE`*  
Sets *KEYFILE* as the public identity file (private key) for the database server. This value is not set by default; it is required only where the database does not exist on the local host.

#### Basic Log Collector Usage

When the `engine-log-collector` command is run without specifying any additional parameters, its default behavior is to collect all logs from oVirt and its attached hosts. It will also collect database logs unless the *`--no-postgresql`* parameter is added. In the following example, log collector is run to collect all logs from oVirt and three attached hosts.

**Example 16.3. Log Collector Usage**

### The ISO Uploader Tool

#### The ISO Uploader Tool

The ISO uploader is a tool for uploading ISO images to the ISO storage domain. It is installed as part of oVirt.

The ISO uploader command is `engine-iso-uploader`. You must log in as the `root` user and provide the administration credentials for the oVirt environment to use this command. The `engine-iso-uploader -h` command displays usage information, including a list of all valid options for the `engine-iso-uploader` command.

#### Syntax for the engine-iso-uploader Command

The basic syntax for the ISO uploader command is:

    engine-iso-uploader [options] list
    engine-iso-uploader [options] upload [file].[file]...[file]

The ISO uploader command supports two actions - *`list`*, and *`upload`*.

*   The *`list`* action lists the ISO storage domains to which ISO files can be uploaded. oVirt creates this list on the machine on which oVirt is installed during the installation process.
*   The *`upload`* action uploads a single ISO file or multiple ISO files separated by spaces to the specified ISO storage domain. NFS is used by default, but SSH is also available.

You must specify one of the above actions when you use the ISO uploader command. Moreover, you must specify at least one local file to use the *`upload`* action.

There are several parameters to further refine the `engine-iso-uploader` command.

**General Options**

*`--version`*  
Displays the version of the ISO uploader command.

*`-h`*, *`--help`*  
Displays information on how to use the ISO uploader command.

*`--conf-file=[PATH]`*

*`--log-file=[PATH]`*  
Sets *[PATH]* as the specific file name the command will use to write log output. The default is `/var/log/ovirt-engine/ovirt-iso-uploader/ovirt-iso-uploader[date].log`.

*`--cert-file=[PATH]`*  
Sets *[PATH]* as the certificate for validating the engine. The default is `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem`.

*`--insecure`*  
Specifies that no attempt will be made to verify the engine.

*`--nossl`*  
Specifies that SSL will not be used to connect to the engine.

*`--quiet`*  
Sets quiet mode, reducing console output to a minimum.

*`-v`*, *`--verbose`*  
Sets verbose mode, providing more console output.

*`-f`*, *`--force`*  
Force mode is necessary when the source file being uploaded has the same file name as an existing file in the destination ISO domain. This option forces the existing file to be overwritten.

**oVirt Options**

*`-u [USER]`*, *`--user=[USER]`*  
Specifies the user whose credentials will be used to execute the command. The *[USER]* is specified in the format *[username]*@*[domain]*. The user must exist in the specified domain and be known to oVirt.

*`-r [FQDN]`*, *`--engine=[FQDN]`*  
Specifies the IP address or fully qualified domain name of oVirt from which the images will be uploaded. It is assumed that the image uploader is being run from the same machine on which oVirt is installed. The default value is `localhost:443`.

**ISO Storage Domain Options**

The following options specify the ISO domain to which the images will be uploaded. These options cannot be used together; you must used either the *`-i`* option or the *`-n`* option.

*`-i`*, *`--iso-domain=[ISODOMAIN]`*  
Sets the storage domain *[ISODOMAIN]* as the destination for uploads.

*`-n`*, *`--nfs-server=[NFSSERVER]`*  
Sets the NFS path *[NFSSERVER]* as the destination for uploads.

**Connection Options**

The ISO uploader uses NFS as default to upload files. These options specify SSH file transfer instead.

*`--ssh-user=[USER]`*  
Sets *[USER]* as the SSH user name to use for the upload. The default is `root`.

*`--ssh-port=[PORT]`*  
Sets *[PORT]* as the port to use when connecting to SSH.

*`-k [KEYFILE]`*, *`--key-file=[KEYFILE]`*  
Sets *[KEYFILE]* as the public key to use for SSH authentication. You will be prompted to enter the password of the user specified with *`--ssh-user=[USER]`* if no key is set.

### Remotely Logging Host Activities

#### Setting Up a Virtualization Host Logging Server

**Summary**

oVirt hosts generate and update log files, recording their actions and problems. Collecting these log files centrally simplifies debugging.

This procedure should be used on your centralized log server. You could use a separate logging server, or use this procedure to enable host logging on oVirt.

**Procedure 17.1. Setting up a Virtualization Host Logging Server**

1.  Configure SELinux to allow **rsyslog** traffic.
        # semanage port -a -t syslogd_port_t -p udp 514

2.  Edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and add below lines:
        $template TmplAuth, "/var/log/%fromhost%/secure" 
        $template TmplMsg, "/var/log/%fromhost%/messages" 

        $RuleSet remote
        authpriv.*   ?TmplAuth
        *.info,mail.none;authpriv.none,cron.none   ?TmplMsg
        $RuleSet RSYSLOG_DefaultRuleset
        $InputUDPServerBindRuleset remote

    Uncomment the following:

        #$ModLoad imudp
        #$UDPServerRun 514

3.  Restart the rsyslog service:
        # service rsyslog restart

**Result**

Your centralized log server is now configured to receive and store the `messages` and `secure` logs from your virtualization hosts.

#### Configuring oVirt Node Hosts to Use a Logging Server

**Summary**

oVirt hosts generate and update log files, recording their actions and problems. Collecting these log files centrally simplifies debugging.

Use this procedure on an oVirt Node host to begin sending log files to your centralized log server.

⁠

**Procedure 17.2. Configuring oVirt Node Hosts to Use a Logging Server**

1.  Log in to your oVirt Node host as `admin` to access the Hypervisors text user interface (TUI) setup screen.
2.  Select **Logging** from the list of options on the left of the screen.
3.  Press the **Tab** key to reach the text entry fields. Enter the IP address or FQDN of your centralized log server and the port it uses.
4.  Press the **Tab** key to reach the **Apply**, and press the **Enter** Key.

**Result**

Your oVirt Node host has been configured to send messages to a centralized log server.

## ⁠Proxies

### SPICE Proxy

#### SPICE Proxy Overview

The SPICE Proxy is a tool used to connect SPICE Clients to guests when the SPICE Clients are outside the network that connects the hypervisors.

Setting up a SPICE Proxy consists of installing **Squid** on a machine and configuring **iptables** to allow proxy traffic through the firewall.

Turning a SPICE Proxy on consists of using **engine-config** on oVirt to set the key `SpiceProxyDefault` to a value consisting of the name and port of the proxy.

Turning a SPICE Proxy off consists of using **engine-config** on oVirt to remove the value that the key `SpiceProxyDefault` has been set to.

#### SPICE Proxy Machine Setup

**Summary**

This procedure explains how to set up a machine as a SPICE Proxy. A SPICE Proxy makes it possible to connect to the oVirt network from outside the network. We use **Squid** in this procedure to provide proxy services.

**Procedure 18.1. Installing Squid on a RHEL Machine**

1.  Install **Squid** on the Proxy machine:
        # yum install squid

2.  Open `/etc/squid/squid.conf`. Change
        http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

    to

        http_access deny CONNECT !Safe_ports

3.  Restart the proxy:
        # service squid restart

4.  Open the default squid port:
        # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3128 -j ACCEPT

5.  Make this iptables rule persistent:
        # iptables-save

**Result**

You have now set up a machine as a SPICE proxy. Before connecting to the oVirt network from outside the network, activate the SPICE proxy.

#### Turning on SPICE Proxy

**Summary**

This procedure explains how to activate (or turn on) the SPICE proxy.

**Procedure 18.2. Activating SPICE Proxy**

1.  On oVirt, use the engine-config tool to set a proxy:
        # engine-config -s SpiceProxyDefault=someProxy

2.  Restart the **ovirt-engine** service:
        # service ovirt-engine restart

    The proxy must have this form:

        protocol://[host]:[port]

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Note:** Only the http protocol is supported by SPICE clients. If https is specified, the client will ignore the proxy setting and attempt a direct connection to the hypervisor

    </div>

**Result**

SPICE Proxy is now activated (turned on). It is now possible to connect to the oVirt network through the SPICE proxy.

#### Turning Off a SPICE Proxy

**Summary**

This procedure explains how to turn off (deactivate) a SPICE proxy.

**Procedure 18.3. Turning Off a SPICE Proxy**

1.  Log in to oVirt:
        $ ssh root@[IP of Manager]

2.  Run the following command to clear the SPICE proxy:
        # engine-config -s SpiceProxyDefault=""

3.  Restart oVirt:
        # service ovirt-engine restart

**Result**

SPICE proxy is now deactivated (turned off). It is no longer possible to connect to the oVirt network through the SPICE proxy.

### Squid Proxy

#### Installing and Configuring a Squid Proxy

**Summary**

This section explains how to install and configure a Squid Proxy to the User Portal.

**Procedure 18.4. Configuring a Squid Proxy**

1.  **Obtaining a Keypair**
    Obtain a keypair and certificate for the HTTPS port of the Squid proxy server.
    You can obtain this keypair the same way that you would obtain a keypair for another SSL/TLS service. The keypair is in the form of two PEM files which contain the private key and the signed certificate. In this document we assume that they are named `proxy.key` and `proxy.cer`.
    The keypair and certificate can also be generated using the certificate authority of the oVirt engine. If you already have the private key and certificate for the proxy and do not want to generate it with the oVirt engine certificate authority, skip to the next step.
2.  **Generating a Keypair**
    Decide on a host name for the proxy. In this procedure, the proxy is called `proxy.example.com`.
    Decide on the rest of the distinguished name of the certificate for the proxy. The important part here is the "common name", which contains the host name of the proxy. Users' browsers use the common name to validate the connection. It is good practice to use the same country and same organization name used by the oVirt engine itself. Find this information by logging in to the oVirt engine machine and running the following command:
        [root@engine ~]# openssl x509 -in /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem -noout -subject

    This command will output something like this:

        subject= /C=US/O=Example Inc./CN=engine.example.com.81108

    The relevant part here is `/C=us/O=Example Inc.`. Use this to build the complete distinguished name for the certificate for the proxy:

        /C=US/O=Example Inc./CN=proxy.example.com

    Log in to the proxy machine and generate a certificate signing request:

        [root@proxy ~]# openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -subj '/C=US/O=Example Inc./CN=proxy.example.com' -nodes -keyout proxy.key -out proxy.req

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Note:** The quotes around the distinguished name for the certificate are very important. Do not leave them out.

    </div>
    The command will generate the key pair. It is very important that the private key is not encrypted (that is the effect of the -nodes option) because otherwise you would need to type the password to start the proxy server.
    The output of the command looks like this:

        Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
        ......................................................+++
        .................................................................................+++
        writing new private key to 'proxy.key'
        -----

    The command will generate two files: `proxy.key` and `proxy.req`. `proxy.key` is the private key. Keep this file safe. `proxy.req` is the certificate signing request. `proxy.req` does not require any special protection.
    To generate the signed certificate, copy the `private.csr` file to the oVirt engine machine, using the **scp** command:

        [root@proxy ~]# scp proxy.req engine.example.com:/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/requests/.

    Log in to the oVirt engine machine and run the following command to sign the certificate:

        [root@engine ~]# /usr/share/ovirt-engine/bin/pki-enroll-request.sh --name=proxy --days=3650 --subject='/C=US/O=Example Inc./CN=proxy.example.com'

    This will sign the certificate and make it valid for 10 years (3650 days). Set the certificate to expire earlier, if you prefer.
    The output of the command looks like this:

        Using configuration from openssl.conf
        Check that the request matches the signature
        Signature ok
        The Subject's Distinguished Name is as follows
        countryName           :PRINTABLE:'US'
        organizationName      :PRINTABLE:'Example Inc.'
        commonName            :PRINTABLE:'proxy.example.com'
        Certificate is to be certified until Jul 10 10:05:24 2023 GMT (3650
        days)

        Write out database with 1 new entries
        Data Base Updated

    The generated certificate file is available in the directory `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/certs` and should be named `proxy.cer`. Copy this file to the proxy machine:

        [root@proxy ~]# scp engine.example.com:/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/certs/proxy.cer .

    Make sure that both the `proxy.key` and `proxy.cer` files are present on the proxy machine:

        [root@proxy ~]# ls -l proxy.key proxy.cer

    The output of this command will look like this:

        -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 4902 Jul 12 12:11 proxy.cer
        -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1834 Jul 12 11:58 proxy.key

    You are now ready to install and configure the proxy server.

3.  **Install the Squid proxy server package**
    Install this system as follows:
        [root@proxy ~]# yum -y install squid

4.  **Configure the Squid proxy server**
    Move the private key and signed certificate to a place where the proxy can access them, for example to the `/etc/squid` directory:
        [root@proxy ~]# cp proxy.key proxy.cer /etc/squid/.

    Set permissions so that the "squid" user can read these files:

        [root@proxy ~]# chgrp squid /etc/squid/proxy.*
        [root@proxy ~]# chmod 640 /etc/squid/proxy.*

    The Squid proxy will connect to the oVirt engine web server using the SSL protocol, and must verify the certificate used by the engine. Copy the certificate of the CA that signed the certificate of the oVirt engine web server to a place where the proxy can access it, for example `/etc/squid`. The default CA certificate is located in the `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem` file in the oVirt engine machine. Copy it with the following command:

        [root@proxy ~]# scp engine.example.com:/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem /etc/squid/.

    Ensure the `squid` user can read that file:

        [root@proxy ~]# chgrp squid /etc/squid/ca.pem
        [root@proxy ~]# chmod 640 /etc/squid/ca.pem

    If SELinux is in enforcing mode, change the context of port 443 using the **semanage** tool. This permits Squid to use port 443.

        [root@proxy ~]# yum install -y policycoreutils-python
        [root@proxy ~]# semanage port -m -p tcp -t http_cache_port_t 443

    Replace the existing squid configuration file with the following:

        https_port 443 key=/etc/squid/proxy.key cert=/etc/squid/proxy.cer ssl-bump defaultsite=engine.example.com
        cache_peer engine.example.com parent 443 0 no-query originserver ssl sslcafile=/etc/squid/ca.pem name=engine
        cache_peer_access engine allow all
        ssl_bump allow all
        http_access allow all

5.  **Restart the Squid Proxy Server**
    Run the following command in the proxy machine:
        [root@proxy ~]# service squid restart

6.  **Configure the websockets proxy**
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Note:** This step is optional. Do this step only to use the noVNC console or the SPICE HTML 5 console.

    </div>
    To use the noVNC or SPICE HTML 5 consoles to connect to the console of virtual machines, the websocket proxy server must be configured on the machine on which the engine is installed. If you selected to configure the websocket proxy server when prompted during installing or upgrading the engine with the `engine-setup` command, the websocket proxy server will already be configured. If you did not select to configure the websocket proxy server at this time, you can configure it later by running the `engine-setup` command with the following option:

        engine-setup --otopi-environment="OVESETUP_CONFIG/websocketProxyConfig=bool:True"

    You must also ensure the **ovirt-websocket-proxy** service is started and will start automatically on boot:

        [root@engine ~]# service ovirt-websocket-proxy status
        [root@engine ~]# chkconfig ovirt-websocket-proxy on

    Both the noVNC and the SPICE HTML 5 consoles use the websocket protocol to connect to the virtual machines, but squid proxy server does not support the websockets protocol, so this communication cannot be proxied with Squid. Tell the system to connect directly to the websockets proxy running in the machine where the engine is running. To do this, update the `WebSocketProxy` configuration parameter using the "engine-config" tool:

        [root@engine ~]# engine-config \
        -s WebSocketProxy=engine.example.com:6100
        [root@engine ~]# service ovirt-engine restart

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Important:** If you skip this step the clients will assume that the websockets proxy is running in the proxy machine, and thus will fail to connect.

    </div>
7.  **Connect to the User Portal using the complete URL**
    Connect to the User Portal using the complete URL, for instance:
        https://proxy.example.com/UserPortal/org.ovirt.engine.ui.userportal.UserPortal/UserPortal.html

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    **Note:** Shorter URLs, for example `https://proxy.example.com/UserPortal`, will not work. These shorter URLs are redirected to the long URL by the application server, using the 302 response code and the Location header. The version of **Squid** in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora (**Squid** version 3.1) does not support rewriting these headers.

    </div>

**Summary**

You have installed and configured a Squid proxy to the User Portal.

## Firewalls

### ⁠oVirt Firewall Requirements

oVirt requires that a number of ports be opened to allow network traffic through the system's firewall. The `engine-setup` script is able to configure the firewall automatically, but this overwrites any pre-existing firewall configuration.

Where an existing firewall configuration exists, you must manually insert the firewall rules required by oVirt instead. The `engine-setup` command saves a list of the `iptables` rules required in the `/usr/share/ovirt-engine/conf/iptables.example` file.

The firewall configuration documented here assumes a default configuration. Where non-default HTTP and HTTPS ports are chosen during installation adjust the firewall rules to allow network traffic on the ports that were selected - not the default ports (`80` and `443`) listed here.

### ⁠Directory Server Firewall Requirements

oVirt requires a directory server to support user authentication. A number of ports must be opened in the directory server's firewall to support GSS-API authentication as used by oVirt.

**Table A.3. Host Firewall Requirements**

</table>

### ⁠Database Server Firewall Requirements

oVirt supports the use of a remote database server. If you plan to use a remote database server with oVirt then you must ensure that the remote database server allows connections from oVirt.

**Table A.4. Host Firewall Requirements**

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="20%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="20%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left"><p>Port(s)</p></th>
<th align="left"><p>Protocol</p></th>
<th align="left"><p>Source</p></th>
<th align="left"><p>Destination</p></th>
<th align="left"><p>Purpose</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>5432</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>TCP, UDP</p></td>
<td align="left"><ul>
<li>oVirt</li>
</ul></td>
<td align="left"><ul>
<li>PostgreSQL database server</li>
</ul></td>
<td align="left"><p>Default port for PostgreSQL database connections.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If you plan to use a local database server on oVirt itself, which is the default option provided during installation, then no additional firewall rules are required.

## oVirt and SSL

### ⁠Replacing oVirt SSL Certificate

**Summary**

You want to use your organization's commercially signed certificate to identify your oVirt to users connecting over https.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Using a commercially issued certificate for https connections does not affect the certificate used for authentication between your oVirt and hosts, they will continue to use the self-signed certificate generated by oVirt.

</div>
Prerequisites

This procedure requires a *PEM* formatted certificate from your commercial certificate issuing authority, a *.nokey* file, and a *.cer* file. The *.nokey* and *.cer* files are sometimes distributed as a certificate-key bundle in the *P12* format.

This procedure assumes that you have a certificate-key bundle in the *P12* format.

**Procedure B.1. Replacing oVirt Apache SSL Certificate**

1.  oVirt has been configured to use `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/apache-ca.pem`, which is symbolically linked to `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem`. Remove the symbolic link.
        # rm /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/apache-ca.pem

2.  Save your commercially issued certificate as `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/apache-ca.pem`.
        mv YOUR-3RD-PARTY-CERT.pem /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/apache-ca.pem

3.  Move your *P12* bundle to `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/apache.p12`.
4.  Extract the key from the bundle.
        # openssl pkcs12 -in  /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/apache.p12 -nocerts -nodes > /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/apache.key.nopass

5.  Extract the certificate from the bundle.
        # openssl pkcs12 -in /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/apache.p12 -nokeys > /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/certs/apache.cer

6.  Restart the Apache server.
        # service httpd restart

**Result**

Your users can now connect to the portals without being warned about the authenticity of the certificate used to encrypt https traffic.
