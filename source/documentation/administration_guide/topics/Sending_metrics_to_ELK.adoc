[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not own or maintain Elasticsearch. You need to have a working familiarity with Elasticsearch setup and maintenance to deploy this option.
====

You can configure the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} and hosts to send metrics data and logs to your existing Elasticsearch instance.

To do this, run the Ansible role that configures `collectd` and `rsyslog` on the {engine-name} and all hosts to collect `engine.log`, `vdsm.log`, and `collectd` metrics, and send them to your Elasticsearch instance.
