==== Syntax for the engine-backup Command

The `engine-backup` command works in one of two basic modes:

[source,terminal]
----
# engine-backup --mode=backup
----

[source,terminal]
----
# engine-backup --mode=restore
----
These two modes are further extended by a set of parameters that allow you to specify the scope of the backup and different credentials for the engine database. Run `engine-backup --help` for a full list of parameters and their function.

*Basic Options*

*`--mode`*:: Specifies whether the command will perform a backup operation or a restore operation. Two options are available - `backup`, and `restore`. This is a required parameter.


*`--file`*:: Specifies the path and name of a file into which backups are to be taken in backup mode, and the path and name of a file from which to read backup data in restore mode. This is a required parameter in both backup mode and restore mode.


*`--log`*:: Specifies the path and name of a file into which logs of the backup or restore operation are to be written. This parameter is required in both backup mode and restore mode.


*`--scope`*:: Specifies the scope of the backup or restore operation. There are four options: `all`, which backs up or restores all databases and configuration data; `files`, which backs up or restores only files on the system; `db`, which backs up or restores only the {engine-name} database; and `dwhdb`, which backs up or restores only the Data Warehouse database. The default scope is `all`.
+
The `--scope` parameter can be specified multiple times in the same `engine-backup` command.

*{engine-name} Database Options*

The following options are only available when using the `engine-backup` command in `restore` mode. The option syntax below applies to restoring the {engine-name} database. The same options exist for restoring the Data Warehouse database. See `engine-backup --help` for the Data Warehouse option syntax.

*`--provision-db`*:: Creates a PostgreSQL database for the {engine-name} database backup to be restored to. This is a required parameter when restoring a backup on a remote host or fresh installation that does not have a PostgreSQL database already configured.


*`--change-db-credentials`*:: Allows you to specify alternate credentials for restoring the {engine-name} database using credentials other than those stored in the backup itself. See `engine-backup --help` for the additional parameters required by this parameter.


*`--restore-permissions` or `--no-restore-permissions`*:: Restores (or does not restore) the permissions of database users. One of these parameters is required when restoring a backup.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a backup contains grants for extra database users, restoring the backup with the `--restore-permissions` and `--provision-db` (or `--provision-dwh-db`) options will create the extra users with random passwords. You must change these passwords manually if the extra users require access to the restored system. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2686731[].
