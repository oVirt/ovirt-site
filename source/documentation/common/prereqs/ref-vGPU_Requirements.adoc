A host must meet the following requirements in order for virtual machines on that host to use a vGPU:

* vGPU-compatible GPU

* GPU-enabled host kernel

* Installed GPU with correct drivers

* Predefined *mdev_type* set to correspond with one of the mdev types supported by the device

* vGPU-capable drivers installed on each host in the cluster

* vGPU-supported virtual machine operating system with vGPU drivers installed
