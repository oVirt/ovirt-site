=== Attaching an ISO Image to a Virtual Machine

To install a guest operating system on a newly created virtual machine, you must attach an ISO file containing the operating system installation media. To locate the ISO file, see xref:Listing_Files_in_an_ISO_Storage_Domain[].

.Attaching an ISO image to a virtual machine
====
This example attaches *my_iso_file.iso* to the `vm1` virtual machine, using the `add` method of the virtual machine's `cdroms` collection.

# Get the reference to the "vms" service:
vms_service = connection.system_service().vms_service()

# Find the virtual machine:
vm = vms_service.list(search='name=vm1')[0]

# Locate the service that manages the virtual machine:
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)

# Locate the service that manages the CDROM devices of the virtual machine:
cdroms_service = vm_service.cdroms_service()

# Get the first CDROM:
cdrom = cdroms_service.list()[0]

# Locate the service that manages the CDROM device found in previous step:
cdrom_service = cdroms_service.cdrom_service(cdrom.id)

# Change the CD of the VM to 'my_iso_file.iso'. By default the
# operation permanently changes the disk that is visible to the
# virtual machine after the next boot, but has no effect
# on the currently running virtual machine. If you want to change the
# disk that is visible to the current running virtual machine, change
# the `current` parameter's value to `True`.
cdrom_service.update(
    cdrom=types.Cdrom(
        file=types.File(
            id='my_iso_file.iso'
        ),
    ),
    current=False,
)

print("Attached CD to '%s'." % vm.name())

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()

If the `add` request is successful, the examples output the text:

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
Attached CD to 'vm1'.

.Ejecting a cdrom from a virtual machine

This example ejects an ISO image from a virtual machine's `cdrom` collection.
