Upgrading your environment from 4.3 to 4.4 involves the following steps:

. xref:Upgrade_Prerequisites_4-3_local_db[Make sure you meet the prerequisites, including enabling the correct repositories].

. xref:Analyzing_the_Environment_4-3_local_db[Use the Log Collection Analysis tool to check for issues that might prevent a successful upgrade].

. xref:Upgrading_the_Manager_to_4-4_4-3_local_db[Upgrade the {engine-name} from 4.3 to 4.4].

. xref:Upgrading_hosts_to_4-4_4-3_local_db[Upgrade hosts while reducing virtual machine downtime].

. xref:Upgrading_hypervisor_preserving_local_storage_4-3_local_db[(Optional) Upgrade {hypervisor-shortname} while preserving local storage].
// . xref:Updating_all_hosts_in_a_cluster_4-3_local_db[Update the hosts]
. xref:Changing_the_Cluster_Compatibility_Version_4-3_local_db[Update the compatibility version of the clusters].
. xref:Changing_Virtual_Machine_Cluster_Compatibility_4-3_local_db[Reboot any running or suspended virtual machines to update their configuration].
. xref:Changing_the_Data_Center_Compatibility_Version_4-3_local_db[Update the compatibility version of the data centers].
. If you previously upgraded to 4.3 without replacing SHA-1 certificates with SHA-256 certificates, xref:Replacing_SHA-1_Certificates_with_SHA-256_Certificates_4-3_local_db[you must replace the certificates now].
