<p>Hosted-engine migration to 4.0</p>

<h1 id="hosted-engine-migration-to-40">Hosted-engine migration to 4.0</h1>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>In 3.6 the engine rpms were released also for el6 so user could deply the hosted-engine on el6.
In 4.0 we are releasing oVirt engine for el7 but not for el6 so we should provide an upgrade path for who deployed hosted-engine using an el6 based VM.</p>

<h3 id="owner">Owner</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Name: Simone Tiraboschi (stirabos)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Email: <a href="mailto:stirabos@redhat.com">stirabos@redhat.com</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="detailed-description">Detailed Description</h3>
<p>The upgrade procedure is long and pretty error prone so we are extending ovirt-hosted-engine-setup to support also this flow and not just only fresh deployments. 
The upgrade flow supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>el6 appliance based hosted-engine -&gt; el7 appliance based hosted-engine</li>
  <li>custom el6 hosted-engine VM -&gt; el7 appliance based hosted-engine
The upgrade flow will not support creating a custom el7 VM.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flow">Flow:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>check global maintenance mode and that VM is locally running</li>
  <li>enforce that we are running on the host where the engine VM is running</li>
  <li>enforce that we are running on the SPM host, if not exit and ask the user to run there</li>
  <li>ask the user to take a backup on the engine VM with engine-backup and copy it back to the host (we are just asking to the user since by default ssh was closed on our old appliances and the effort to open it is not that different than taking the backup).</li>
  <li>check the backup content</li>
  <li>ask all the missing information (the exact list depend on how 3.6 was deployed and so what is on the answer file on the shared storage)</li>
  <li>use the 3.6 engine to create a new floating disk for backup pourposes on the hosted-engine storage domain (the use has to resize the hosted-engine storage domain from the engien if we don’t have enough free space for the additional disk)</li>
  <li>shutdown the engine VM</li>
  <li>backup the old engine VM disk to the new backup disk</li>
  <li>transfer the 4.0/el7 appliance over the engine VM disk (the procedure can also extend the volume if required)</li>
  <li>inject the engine backup to the engine VM disk with guestfish</li>
  <li>generate a new cloud-init image to configure the el7 appliance</li>
  <li>tweak vm.conf on the fly to attach the cloud-init image</li>
  <li>boot the engine VM, this will:</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>configure the appliance via cloud-init</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>not interactively (from cloud-init and checking the output over a virtio channel) run engine-backup to restore the 3.6 backup</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>not interactively  (from cloud-init and checking the output over a virtio channel) run engine-setup to configure the 4.0 engine</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>check the engine status</li>
  <li>via REST api, scan external disks and add the floating backup disk to the engine since it was created after the backup was taken</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rollback">Rollback</h3>
<p>At the end of the procedure, the backup disk will contain a copy of the engine VM disk before the upgrade.
The backup can be rolled back at any time with the –rollback-upgrade option.
Deleting backup images if not needed is up to the user.</p>

<h3 id="benefit-to-ovirt">Benefit to oVirt</h3>

<p>The user will be able to upgrade</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Set the global maintenance mode</li>
  <li>Put the host where the engin VM is running into maintenance</li>
  <li>Add the 4.0 repo and upgrade the host</li>
</ul>

<p>Run hosted-engine-setup –upgrade-appliance</p>

          Continuing will upgrade the engine VM running on this hosts deploying and configuring a new appliance.
          If your engine VM is already based on el7 you can also simply upgrade the engine there.
          This procedure will create a new disk on the hosted-engine storage domain and it will backup there the content of your current engine VM disk.
          The new el7 based appliance will be deployed over the existing disk destroying its content; at any time you will be able to rollback using the content of the backup disk.
          You will be asked to take a backup of the running engine and copy it to this host.
          The engine backup will be automatically injected and recovered on the new appliance.
