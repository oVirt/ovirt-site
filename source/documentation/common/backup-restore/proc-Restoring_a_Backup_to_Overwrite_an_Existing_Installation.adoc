= Restoring a Backup to Overwrite an Existing Installation

The `engine-backup` command can restore a backup to a machine on which the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} has already been installed and set up. This is useful when you have taken a backup of an environment, performed changes on that environment, and then want to undo the changes by restoring the environment from the backup.

Changes made to the environment since the backup was taken, such as adding or removing a host, will not appear in the restored environment. You must redo these changes.


.Procedure

. Log in to the {engine-name} machine.

. Remove the configuration files and clean the database associated with the {engine-name}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# engine-cleanup
----
+
The `engine-cleanup` command only cleans the {engine-name} database; it does not drop the database or delete the user that owns that database.

. Restore a full backup or a database-only backup. You do not need to create a new database or specify the database credentials because the user and database already exist.

* Restore a full backup:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# engine-backup --mode=restore --file=_file_name_ --log=_log_file_name_ --restore-permissions
----
+
* Restore a database-only backup by restoring the configuration files and the database backup:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# engine-backup --mode=restore --scope=files --scope=db --scope=dwhdb --file=_file_name_ --log=_log_file_name_ --restore-permissions
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To restore only the {engine-name} database (for example, if the Data Warehouse database is located on another machine), you can omit the `--scope=dwhdb` parameter.
====
+
If successful, the following output displays:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
You should now run engine-setup.
Done.
----

. Reconfigure the {engine-name}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# engine-setup
----
