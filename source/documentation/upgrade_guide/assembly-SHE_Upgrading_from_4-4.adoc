:context: 4-4_SHE
:4-4_SHE:

Upgrading a self-hosted engine environment from version 4.4 to 4.5 involves the following steps:

. xref:Upgrade_Prerequisites_4-4_SHE[Make sure you meet the prerequisites, including enabling the correct repositories]

. xref:Migrating_VMs_from_SHE_host_4-4[Migrate any virtual machines that are running on the same host as the {engine-name} virtual machine to another host in the same cluster]

. xref:Enabling_Global_Maintenance_Mode_4-4_SHE[Place the environment in global maintenance mode]

. xref:Updating_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_4-4_SHE[Update the 4.4 {engine-name} to the latest version of 4.4]

. xref:Upgrading_the_Manager_to_4-5_4-4_SHE[Upgrade the {engine-name} from 4.4 to 4.5]

. xref:Upgrading_hosts_to_4-5_4-4_SHE[Upgrade the self-hosted engine nodes, and any standard hosts, while reducing virtual machine downtime]

. xref:Changing_the_Cluster_Compatibility_Version_4-4_SHE[Update the compatibility version of the clusters]

. xref:Changing_Virtual_Machine_Cluster_Compatibility_4-4_SHE[Reboot any running or suspended virtual machines to update their configuration]

[id='Migrating_VMs_from_SHE_host_4-4']
== Migrating virtual machines from the self-hosted engine host

Only the {engine-name} virtual machine should remain on the host until after you have finished upgrading the host. Migrate any virtual machines other than the {engine-name} virtual machine to another host in the same cluster.

You can use Live Migration to minimize virtual machine down-time. For more information, see
link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}virtual_machine_management_guide/index#sect-Migrating_Virtual_Machines_Between_Hosts[Migrating Virtual Machines Between Hosts] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_ for more information.

You can now update the {engine-name} to the latest version of 4.4.

include::common/upgrade/proc-Updating_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

You can now upgrade the {engine-name} to 4.5.

include::common/upgrade/proc-Upgrading_the_Manager_to_4-5.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// Add new {engine-name} upgrade versions here

You can now update the self-hosted engine nodes, and then any standard hosts. The procedure is the same for both host types.
