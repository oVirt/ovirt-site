## Summary

Real-time monitoring will provide visibility into the user's complete infrastructure.

## Current Status

*   Target Release: 4.1
*   Status: Released
*   Last updated: Mon 12 Jun 2017

## Description

In 4.1, collectd and fluentd are already installed on the hosts and engine machines.
We have an Ansible script that configures them on all relevant hosts.

We plan to continue adding additional logs and metrics as required, add pre-defined dashboards and alerting that will detect and notify the user when something goes wrong in the environment, based on SLA events, thresholds, etc.
