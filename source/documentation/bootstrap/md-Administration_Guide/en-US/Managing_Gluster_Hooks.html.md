# Managing Gluster Hooks

Gluster hooks are volume life cycle extensions. You can manage Gluster hooks from the Manager. The content of the hook can be viewed if the hook content type is **Text**.

Through the Manager, you can perform the following:

* View the content and status of hooks.

* Enable or disable hooks.

* Resolve hook conflicts.
