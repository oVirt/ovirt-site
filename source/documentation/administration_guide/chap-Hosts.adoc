==== fence_kdump Advanced Configuration

*kdump*

Click the name of a host to view the status of the kdump service in the *General* tab of the details view:

* *Enabled*: kdump is configured properly and the kdump service is running.

* *Disabled*: the kdump service is not running (in this case kdump integration will not work properly).

* *Unknown*: happens only for hosts with an earlier VDSM version that does not report kdump status.

For more information on installing and using kdump, see the link:{URL_rhel_docs_legacy}html/Kernel_Crash_Dump_Guide/index.html[{enterprise-linux} 7 Kernel Crash Dump Guide].

*fence_kdump*

Enabling *Kdump integration* in the *Power Management* tab of the *New Host* or *Edit Host* window configures a standard fence_kdump setup. If the environment's network configuration is simple and the {engine-name}'s FQDN is resolvable on all hosts, the default fence_kdump settings are sufficient for use.

However, there are some cases where advanced configuration of fence_kdump is necessary. Environments with more complex networking may require manual changes to the configuration of the {engine-name}, fence_kdump listener, or both. For example, if the {engine-name}'s FQDN is not resolvable on all hosts with *Kdump integration* enabled, you can set a proper host name or IP address using `engine-config`:
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
engine-config -s FenceKdumpDestinationAddress=_A.B.C.D_
----

The following example cases may also require configuration changes:

* The {engine-name} has two NICs, where one of these is public-facing, and the second is the preferred destination for fence_kdump messages.

* You need to execute the fence_kdump listener on a different IP or port.

* You need to set a custom interval for fence_kdump notification messages, to prevent possible packet loss.

Customized fence_kdump detection settings are recommended for advanced users only, as changes to the default configuration are only necessary in more complex networking setups. For configuration options for the fence_kdump listener see xref:fence_kdump_listener_Configuration[fence_kdump listener Configuration].
For configuration of kdump on the {engine-name} see xref:Configuring_fence_kdump_on_the_Manager[Configuring fence_kdump on the Manager].
