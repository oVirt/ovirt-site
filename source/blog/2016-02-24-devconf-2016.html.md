On the first weekend of February I had the pleasure of attending DevConf.CZ 2016, which took place in the wonderful city of Brno, Czech Republic.
It's a relaxed, young and vibrant conference and it was fun and rewarding from my perspective.
Here's a disorganized personal summary:

- Met many community members from all over Europe. Was excited to see so many happy users of the project!
- Attended [in-depth look of virtual machine migration algorithms - Marcelo Tosatti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkMIMJKJeTY "in-depth look of virtual machine migration algorithms - Marcelo Tosatti"). I hope to see some of it in coming versions of QEMU, while we work on other improvements to this critical feature.
- [Growing the ARM server ecosystem - Jim Perrin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gU87wdRtI "Growing the ARM server ecosystem - Jim Perrin") was interesting. Seems like a great positive effort, but the road is still long for complete support. Would be cool to support ARM based hosts running virtual machines!
- Attended [Qemu Disk I/O: Which performs better, Native or Threads? - Pradeep K Surisetty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx93riUF5_I "Qemu Disk I/O: Which performs better, Native or Threads? - Pradeep K Surisetty"). The results were not conclusive, though some improvements in native brought it close to, or in some cases better than threads. Seems that our default of heuristic for threads in file-based storage and native in block based storage is fine for the time being, but we'll watch closely for developments in this area.
- Attended [Debugging the Virtualization Layer (libvirt and QEMU) in OpenStack - Kashyap Chamarthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd2AGGMWXQM "Debugging the Virtualization Layer (libvirt and QEMU) in OpenStack - Kashyap Chamarthy") - I think (and asked) if libvirt can do a better job - in saving in a cyclic log the QMP commands sent and the response from the guest and dump it in case of a guest crash.
- Paid a visit to [Cockpit Hackfest - Dominik Perpeet, Marius Vollmer, Peter Volpe, Stef Walter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNDe90WSZow "Cockpit Hackfest - Dominik Perpeet, Marius Vollmer, Peter Volpe, Stef Walter") - as we intend to use Cockpit as our UI for oVirt Next Generation Node, it was great to present our use case and exchange thoughts, ideas and directions. Few bugs were filed during the hackfest per our comments.
- Attended [Dockerizing JBoss Products - David Becvarik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpyEoFlDzOQ "Dockerizing JBoss Products - David Becvarik"). Great work done by the JBoss team to improve and streamline packaging of JBoss into containers.
- Attended [Upstream First Testing - Tim Flink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15-yXOJuonQ "Upstream First Testing - Tim Flink"). I discussed with the presenter the possibility to run oVirt with [Lago project on GitHub](https://github.com/lago-project/lago "Lago project on GitHub") in Fedora, in a CI way, by monitoring distgit changes for relevant packages (such as lvm2, device-mapper*, libvirt and others.
- Attended [High performance VMs in OpenStack - Nikola Dipanov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J_sEdlpIlQ "High performance VMs in OpenStack - Nikola Dipanov") - looks like oVirt is already doing a lot of what OpenStack is working on to achieve high-performance from KVM!
- Preached on running Lago with OpenStack, Gluster and Cockpit. At least the first two items look really promising and I'm looking forward to a collaboration in those efforts. I might just try to do the Gluster one myself.
- [Avocado and Jenkins: Test Automation and CI - Lukáš Doktor, Yash Mankad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqavfmPAt7o "Avocado and Jenkins: Test Automation and CI - Lukáš Doktor, Yash Mankad") was interesting for me, as Avocado seems like a cool, mature testing framework - which I hope we can use in the future in CI testing.
- Having used the [oVirt Live](http://www.ovirt.org/download/ovirt-live/"http://www.ovirt.org/download/ovirt-live/") USB DoK image in both FOSDEM and DevConf, I've found several items where we can improve in and filed relevant RFEs for them [1][2].

- The oVirt team has delivered numerous presentations in the virtualization track:
[Smart VM Scheduling - Martin Sivák](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQqJEiK7-Ug "Smart VM Scheduling - Martin Sivák")
[Host fencing in oVirt - Fixing the unknown and allowing VMs to be highly available - Martin Peřina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1JQtmdleaM "Host fencing in oVirt - Fixing the unknown and allowing VMs to be highly available - Martin Peřina") ,
[Ceph integration with oVirt using Cinder - Nir Soffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CbHTAkVDZo "Ceph integration with oVirt using Cinder - Nir Soffer").
- The Gluster team has additionally provided more presentations:
[oVirt and Gluster Hyperconvergence - Ramesh Nachimuthu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XudYwEWQF7U "oVirt and Gluster Hyperconvergence - Ramesh Nachimuthu") ,
[Improvements in gluster for virtualization use case - Prasanna Kumar Kalever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TczVVCbm8NE "Improvements in gluster for virtualization use case - Prasanna Kumar Kalever"), which were all well received.

I'd like to thank our project's current community manager Mikey Ariel, and former community manager Brian Proffitt for once again, just one week after FOSDEM, leading the effort of representing the oVirt project and community in this event.
