= Switch Configuration for Bonding

Switch configurations vary per the requirements of your hardware. Refer to the deployment and networking configuration guides for your operating system.

For every type of switch it is important to set up the switch bonding with the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) protocol and *not* the Cisco Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) protocol.
