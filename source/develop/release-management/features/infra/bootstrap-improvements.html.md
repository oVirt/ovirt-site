Current bootstrap implementaiton is mainly legacy code. Too much bootstrap sequences and low control over the process.

*   vdsm-bootstrap as standalone package.
*   Two sequences
    -   Bootstrap

*   ovirt-node registration has no ovirt logic, just “I'm here” notification.
*   Establish a bidirectional channel between back-end and host, no iterative commands nor file transfers.
*   Manual invocation support.
*   Better timeout management.
*   Better logging.
*   Use of yum API.
*   Shorter bootstrap time.
