= Installing {virt-product-fullname} as a standalone {engine-name} with local databases
include::../common/collateral_files/ovirt-attributes.adoc[]
:context: SM_localDB_deploy
:SM_localDB_deploy:


Standalone {engine-name} installation is manual and customizable. You must install a {enterprise-linux} machine, then run the configuration script (`engine-setup`) and provide information about how you want to configure the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}. Add hosts and storage after the {engine-name} is running. At least two hosts are required for virtual machine high availability.

In a local database environment, the {engine-name} database and Data Warehouse database can be created automatically by the {engine-name} configuration script. Alternatively, you can create these databases manually on the {engine-name} machine before running `engine-setup`.

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4-beta/html/planning_and_prerequisites_guide/[_Planning and Prerequisites Guide_] for information on environment options and recommended configuration.

== Installation Overview

Installing a standalone {engine-name} environment with local databases involves the following steps:

. xref:Installing_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_SM_localDB_deploy[Install and configure the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}:]
.. xref:Installing_RHEL_for_RHVM_SM_localDB_deploy[Install a {enterprise-linux} machine for the {engine-name}.]
.. xref:Enabling_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_Repositories_install_RHVM[Enable the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} repositories.]
.. xref:Configuring_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_install_RHVM[Install and Configure the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} using `engine-setup`.]
.. xref:Connecting_to_the_Administration_Portal_install_RHVM[Connect to the Administration Portal to add hosts and storage domains.]

. xref:Installing_Hosts_for_RHV_SM_localDB_deploy[Install hosts to run virtual machines on:]
.. Use either host type, or both:
* xref:Red_Hat_Virtualization_Hosts_SM_localDB_deploy[{hypervisor-fullname}]
* xref:Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_hosts_SM_localDB_deploy[{enterprise-linux}]
.. xref:Adding_standard_hosts_to_the_Manager_SM_localDB_deploy[Add the hosts to the {engine-name}.]

. xref:Preparing_Storage_for_RHV_SM_localDB_deploy[Prepare storage to use for storage domains.] You can use one of the following storage types:
* xref:Preparing_NFS_Storage_SM_localDB_deploy[NFS]
* xref:Preparing_iSCSI_Storage_SM_localDB_deploy[iSCSI]
* xref:Preparing_FCP_Storage_SM_localDB_deploy[Fibre Channel (FCP)]
* xref:Preparing_POSIX_Storage_SM_localDB_deploy[POSIX-compliant file system]
* xref:Preparing_Local_Storage_SM_localDB_deploy[Local storage]
* xref:Preparing_Red_Hat_Gluster_Storage_SM_localDB_deploy[{gluster-storage-fullname}]

. xref:Adding_Storage_Domains_to_RHV_SM_localDB_deploy[Add storage domains to the {engine-name}.]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keep the environment up to date. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2974891[] for more information. Since bug fixes for known issues are frequently released, use scheduled tasks to update the hosts and the {engine-name}.

== Installing the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}
:context: install_RHVM

Installing the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} involves the following steps:

. xref:Installing_RHEL_for_RHVM_SM_localDB_deploy[Preparing the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} Machine]
. xref:Enabling_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_Repositories_install_RHVM[Enabling the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} Repositories]
. xref:Configuring_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_install_RHVM[Installing and Configuring the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}]

=== Preparing the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} Machine

The {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} must run on {enterprise-linux} 7. For detailed instructions on installing {enterprise-linux}, see the link:{URL_rhel_docs_legacy}html/Installation_Guide/index.html[_{enterprise-linux} 7 Installation Guide_].

This machine must meet the minimum xref:hardware-requirements_SM_localDB_deploy[{engine-name} hardware requirements].

By default, the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}'s configuration script, `engine-setup`, creates and configures the {engine-name} database and Data Warehouse database automatically on the {engine-name} machine. To set up either database, or both, manually, see xref:Preparing_a_Local_Manually-Configured_PostgreSQL_Database_SM_localDB_deploy[] before configuring the {engine-name}.
