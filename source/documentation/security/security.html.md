# Security

## Reporting security issues

Please report any security issues you find in oVirt projects to:

security at ovirt.org

Anyone can post to this list. The subscribers are only trusted individuals who will handle the resolution of any reported security issues in confidence. In your report, please note how you would like to be credited for discovering the issue and the details of any embargo you would like to impose. Currently the security response teams for the following distributions are subscribed to this list and will respond to your report:

*   Fedora
*   Red Hat

## Handling security issues

If you represent an oVirt project or a distribution which packages oVirt projects, you are welcome to subscribe to the security at ovirt.org mailing list. Your subscription will only be approved if you can demonstrate that you will handle issues in confidence and properly credit reporters for discovering issues. A second mailing list exists for discussion of embargoed security issues:

security-private at ovirt.org

You will be invited to subscribe to this list if you are subscribed to security at ovirt.org.

## Security advisories

The [security advisories](security advisories) page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in oVirt.
