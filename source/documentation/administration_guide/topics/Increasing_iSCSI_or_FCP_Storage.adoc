= Increasing iSCSI or FCP Storage

There are several ways to increase iSCSI or FCP storage size:

* Add an existing LUN to the current storage domain.
* Create a new storage domain with new LUNs and add it to an existing data center. See xref:Adding_iSCSI_Storage_storage_admin[Adding iSCSI Storage].
* Expand the storage domain by resizing the underlying LUNs.

For information about configuring or resizing FCP storage, see link:{URL_rhel_docs_latest}html-single/managing_storage_devices/index#using-fibre-channel-devices_managing-storage-devices[Using Fibre Channel Devices] in _Managing storage devices_ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

The following procedure explains how to expand storage area network (SAN) storage by adding a new LUN to an existing storage domain.

*Prerequisites*

* The storage domain's status must be `UP`.
*  The LUN must be accessible to all the hosts whose status is `UP`, or else the operation will fail and the LUN will not be added to the domain. The hosts themselves, however, will not be affected. If a newly added host, or a host that is coming out of maintenance or a `Non Operational` state, cannot access the LUN, the host's state will be `Non Operational`.

*Increasing an Existing iSCSI or FCP Storage Domain*

. Click menu:Storage[Domains] and select an iSCSI or FCP domain.
. Click btn:[Manage Domain].
. Click menu:Targets[LUNs] and click the *Discover Targets* expansion button.
. Enter the connection information for the storage server and click btn:[Discover] to initiate the connection.
. Click menu:LUNs[Targets] and select the check box of the newly available LUN.
. Click btn:[OK] to add the LUN to the selected storage domain.

This will increase the storage domain by the size of the added LUN.

When expanding the storage domain by resizing the underlying LUNs, the LUNs must also be refreshed in the Administration Portal.

*Refreshing the LUN Size*

. Click menu:Storage[Domains] and select an iSCSI or FCP domain.
. Click menu:Manage Domain[].
. Click menu:LUNs[Targets].
. In the *Additional Size* column, click btn:[Add _Additional_Storage_Size_] button of the LUN to refresh.
. Click btn:[OK] to refresh the LUN to indicate the new storage size.
