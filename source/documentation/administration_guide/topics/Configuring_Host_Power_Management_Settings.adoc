==== Configuring Host Power Management Settings

Configure your host power management device settings to perform host life-cycle operations (stop, start, restart) from the Administration Portal.

You must configure host power management in order to utilize host high availability and virtual machine high availability. For more information about power management devices, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4/html/technical_reference/power_management[Power Management] in the _Technical Reference_.
