= Enabling and configuring the firewall

[role="_abstract"]
`firewalld` must be installed and running before you run the self-hosted deployment script. You must also have an active zone with an interface configured.

.Prerequisites

* `firewalld` is installed. `hosted-engine-setup` requires the `firewalld` package, so you do not need to do any additional steps.

.Procedure

. Start `firewalld`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl unmask firewalld
# systemctl start firewalld
----
+
To ensure firewalld starts automatically at system start, enter the following command as root:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl enable firewalld
----

. Ensure that firewalld is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl status firewalld
----

. Ensure that your management interface is in a firewall zone via
+
[source,terminal]
----
# firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
----

Now you are ready to deploy the self-hosted engine.
