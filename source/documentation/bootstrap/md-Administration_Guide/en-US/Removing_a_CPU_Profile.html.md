# Removing a CPU Profile

Remove an existing CPU profile from your Red Hat Virtualization environment.

**Removing a CPU Profile**

1. Click the **Clusters** resource tab and select a cluster.

2. Click the **CPU Profiles** sub tab in the details pane.

3. Select the CPU profile to remove.

You have removed a CPU profile, and that CPU profile is no longer available. If the CPU profile was assigned to any virtual machines, those virtual machines are automatically assigned the `default` CPU profile.
