## Detailed Description

This feature adds four hooking points to vdsm, for before and after a disk's hot plug and unplug from a VM.
These hooking points are named:
1. before_disk_hotplug
2. after_disk_hotplug
3. before_disk_hotunplug
4. after_disk_hotunplug
 The above hooking points are defined in vdsm/hooks.py, and used in vdsm/libvirtvm.py.

## Benefit to oVirt

The feature allows customers to add their own functionality before hot-plugging and hot-unplugging disks.
 This can be done by adding scripts performing custom behaviour.
More details regarding the actual usage can be found [here](/develop/developer-guide/vdsm/hooks/) and [here](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.0/html/Administration_Guide/VDSM_Hooks.html/).
