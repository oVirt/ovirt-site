# Privacy Statement for the oVirt Project

## Scope of This Notice

This Privacy Statement is intended to describe the oVirt Project's privacy practices and provide information about the choices you have regarding the ways in which information collected by the oVirt Project is used and disclosed. For convenience, the oVirt Project is referred to in this document as "oVirt".

## Our Commitment to Privacy

At oVirt, your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we have provided this Statement explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected, used and disclosed. To make this Statement easy to find, we have made it available on our homepage and at every location where personally-identifiable information may be requested.

## The Information We Collect

This Privacy Statement applies to all information collected by or submitted to oVirt, including personal data. "Personal data" is data that can be used to identify an individual.

oVirt collects personal data when:
- you create a Gerrit and/or Bugzilla user account;
- you participate in surveys and evaluations;
- you submit questions or comments to us.

oVirt may also collect personal data from individuals (with their consent) at conventions, trade shows and expositions.

The types of personal data collected may include (but are not limited to):
- your first and last name;
- your title and your company's name;
- your e-mail address;
- any other identifier that permits oVirt to make physical or online contact with you;
- any information that oVirt collects online from you and maintains in association with your account, such as:
- your GPG key ID,
- your SSH public key,
- your IRC nickname,
- your language preference,
- your timezone.

## Publicly Available Personal Data

In keeping with the open nature and spirit of oVirt, some personal data attached to oVirt accounts is made public by default. Specifically:
- your first and last name;
- your email address;
- your language preference;
- your SSH public key;
- your timezone;
- your GPG key ID (if defined);
- your IRC nickname (if defined).

If you wish for this information to be kept private, you can opt-out of displaying this information publicly in your gerrit account preferences. If you choose to opt-out, oVirt will still have access to this information, but it will not be displayed based on Gerrit capabilities to others, and will be considered Private. The only exception to this is for your email address, which may still be visible in some oVirt services such as Bugzilla.

## Using (Processing) Your Personal Data

oVirt uses the personal data you provide to:
- create and maintain your accounts;
- attribute data and content you produce directly and indirectly in our public-facing services;
- answer your questions;
- send you information;
- for research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is not used to contact the subjects of the report);
- send you surveys.

It is in oVirt’s legitimate business interests to provide you with the information, communications, and services you request; to create a public record of the data and content produced by oVirt’s services; and to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes.

## Sharing Your Personal Data

Unless you consent, oVirt will never process or share the personal data you provide to us except as described below.
oVirt may disclose your personal data to third parties under any of the following circumstances:
- Your publicly available personal data in the Gerrit  account system, as described above, is accessible by anyone unless you, as the account holder, opt out as already described in this Privacy Statement.
- As required to provide service, and for e-mail housing (as a consequence of uses already described in this Privacy Statement). It is in oVirt’s legitimate business interest to provide all users an accurate record of data and content provided by oVirt’s services, and to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes. This data and content may include but is not limited to email, code changes, comments, and artifacts. 
- As required by law (such as responding to a valid subpoena, warrant, audit, or agency action, or to prevent fraud).
- For research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is used to describe our services and is not used to contact the subjects of the report).

## Receiving E-Mail

For your protection, oVirt may contact you in the event that we find an issue that requires your immediate attention. oVirt processes your personal data in these cases to fulfill and comply with its contractual obligations to you, to provide the services you have requested.

## Cookies and Other Browser Information

oVirt's online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our services. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your location, in order to provide you data and content from our services as quickly as possible. It is in oVirt’s legitimate business interest to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of its services for all users.
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, oVirt uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of [Community Website] where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies.

Generally, we use cookies to:
- Remind us of who you are and to access your gerrit account information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "sign in" and is modified when you "sign out" of our services.
- Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing oVirt gerrit is given a unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of repeat usage and usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.
- Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of oVirt's network of websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our user's habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on [Community Website] a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions you and other users will see on our sites.

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located in the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility).

## Our Commitment to Data Security

oVirt trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines and makes our privacy policy available to our partners. Our website uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal data when you send your personal information on the Gerrit website. In addition, oVirt and its partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your personal data.

## Public Forums Reminder

oVirt often makes chat rooms, forums, mailing lists, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal data. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, oVirt reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. It is in oVirt’s legitimate business interests to provide all users an accurate record of data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and propagation of open source software.

## Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy

Out of special concern for children's privacy, oVirt does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. oVirt does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites. oVirt does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.
In the event that oVirt ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, oVirt will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.

## About Links to Other Sites

This site contains links to other sites. oVirt does not control the information collection of sites that can be reached through links from https://ovirt.org. If you have questions about the data collection procedures of linked sites, please contact these sites directly.
