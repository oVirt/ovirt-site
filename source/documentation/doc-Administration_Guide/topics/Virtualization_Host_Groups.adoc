[[Virtualization_Host_Groups]]
==== Virtualization Host Groups


A number of system user groups are created on the virtualization host when the `vdsm` and `qemu-kvm-rhev` packages are installed. Each system user group has a default group identifier (GID). The system user groups created are:

* The *kvm* group (GID `36`). Group members include:


* The *qemu* user.

* The *sanlock* user.


* The *qemu* group (GID `107`). Group members include:


* The *vdsm* user.

* The *sanlock* user.


* The *ovirt-vmconsole* group (GID `498`). Group members include:


* The *ovirt-vmconsole* user.



[IMPORTANT]
====
The user identifiers (UIDs) and group identifiers (GIDs) allocated may vary between systems. The *vdsm* user is fixed to a UID of `36` and the *kvm* group is fixed to a GID of `36`.

If UID `36` or GID `36` is already used by another account on the system a conflict will arise during installation of the `vdsm` and `qemu-kvm-rhev` packages.
