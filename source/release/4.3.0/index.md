# oVirt 4.3.0 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.3.0 release as of February 04, 2019.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6,
CentOS Linux 7.6 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.3.0, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from oVirt Engine 4.2 you just need to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt Node NG 4.2 you just need to execute:

      # yum install https://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-4.3/rpm/el7/noarch/ovirt-node-ng-image-update-4.3.0-1.el7.noarch.rpm
      # reboot


### Fedora Tech Preview

With oVirt 4.3 we are reintroducing Fedora 28 as platform for running oVirt in tech preview.
More recent builds for Fedora are built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
For some of the work to be done to completely restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## Known Issues
- [Bug 1672587 - VNC encryption is true on host after upgrade causing "Unsupported security types: 19"](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1672587) causes VNC console to be broken. As a workaround, disable the vnc_tls flag on the Host and restart libvirt, or use SPICE. See the BZ for details.
- [Bug 1662047 – [UI] 2 dashboard icons after upgrade](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1662047) causes 2 dashboard icons after upgrade. An async fix has already been published. New standalone and hosted engine upgrades will catch the fix. If you have already upgraded to 4.3.0 and see the issue, run `yum update` and `engine-setup` on your Engine.

## What's New in 4.3.0?

### Release Note

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1655115](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1655115) <b>Drop 3.6 and 4.0 datacenter/cluster level</b><br>The current release removes the VDSM daemon's support for cluster levels 3.6/4.0 and Red Hat Virtualization Manager 3.6/4.0. This means that VDSM from RHV 4.3 cannot be used with the Manager from RHV 3.6/4.0. To use the new version of VDSM, upgrade the Manager to version 4.1 or higher.
 - [BZ 1514004](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1514004) <b>[downstream clone - 4.3.0] [RFE] Drop TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 encryption protocols support</b><br>The TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols are no longer secure. They have been forcefully disabled in the VDSM configuration and cannot be enabled.<br><br>Only TLSv1.2 and higher versions of the protocol are enabled. The exact version enabled depends on the underlying OpenSSL version.

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1627756](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1627756) <b>On engine side replace fluentd dependencies with rsyslog</b><br>The current release replaces Fluentd with Rsyslog for collecting oVirt logs and collectd metrics. Systems running Red Hat Virtualization Manager and upgraded from 4.2 will still have Fluentd installed but it will be disabled and stopped.<br>After upgrading to 4.3, you can remove the Fluentd packages.
 - [BZ 1550634](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1550634) <b>Drop 3.6 and 4.0 datacenter/cluster level</b><br>This release removes the Red Hat Virtualization Manager support for clusters levels 3.6 and 4.0. Customers must upgrade their data centers to Red Hat Virtualization Manager 4.1 or later before upgrading to Red Hat Virtualization Manager 4.3.
 - [BZ 1599321](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1599321) <b>Config values inconsistency between RHV versions</b><br>There are inconsistencies in the following internal configuration options:<br>- HotPlugCpuSupported<br>- HotUnplugCpuSupported<br>- HotPlugMemorySupported<br>- HotUnplugMemorySupported<br>- IsMigrationSupported<br>- IsMemorySnapshotSupported<br>- IsSuspendSupported<br>- ClusterRequiredRngSourcesDefault<br>Systems that have upgraded from RHV 4.0 to RHV 4.1/4.2 and are experiencing problems with these features should upgrade to RHV 4.2.5 or later.
 - [BZ 1651220](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1651220) <b>Require Ansible 2.7+</b><br>This release adds a requirement for Ansible version 2.7, the lowest version required to run oVirt Ansible roles.

#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1627753](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1627753) <b>On hosts replace fluentd dependencies with rsyslog</b><br>The current release replaces Fluentd with Rsyslog for collecting oVirt logs and collectd metrics.<br>Hosts upgraded from 4.2 will still have Fluentd installed, but the service is disabled and stopped.<br>After upgrading to 4.3, you can remove the fluentd packages.

#### oVirt Release Package

 - [BZ 1609884](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1609884) <b>ovirt-release-master for centos doesn't contain current ovirt-web-ui</b><br>In this release, the oVirt release package for master, ovirt-release-master, enables a new repository hosted on the Cool Other Package Repositories (COPR) service for delivering ovirt-web-ui packages.

### Enhancements

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1644693](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1644693) <b>High Host CPU load for Windows 10 Guests (Update 1803)  when idle</b><br>Feature: Added enlightenment support in order to reduce CPU load by enabling the hyper-visor synic and stimer states.  <br><br>Reason: To improve performance when running Windows as a guest OS.<br><br>Result: Anticipated results are that CPU load will be reduced to 0-5% on Linux Virtual Machines.
 - [BZ 1641125](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1641125) <b>[RFE] add a configuration policy for vGPU placement</b><br>It is now possible to set in host configuration preferred vGPU placement on physical cards. Separated placement prefers putting each vGPU on a separate physical card, consolidated placement prefers putting more vGPUs on available physical cards.
 - [BZ 1598391](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1598391) <b>[RFE] - Certify OSP 14 with OVN as an external network provider on RHV 4.3</b><br>Neutron from OSP 14 configured to use OVN can be used as an external network provider on RHV 4.3 with the limitation described in bug 1655906 .
 - [BZ 1625612](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1625612) <b>[RHV] failed to convert VMware ESX VM with snapshot</b><br>Feature: Removes the code within the VDSM blocking the importing of VMWare VMs with snap shots in order to take advantage of virt-v2v support for importing these types of VMs that was added to the virt-v2v-1.36.10-6.el7.x86_64.rpm package.<br><br>Reason: We would like to expose this feature for use by oVirt users.<br><br>Result: oVirt now supports the importing of VMware VMs that include snap shots.
 - [BZ 1587892](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1587892) <b>After importing KVM VM the actual size is bigger than the virtual size</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Added KVM Sparseness support to KVM to oVirt Virtual Machine Importing so that when Thin Provisioning is enabled, the Disk Size of the original KVM Image will be preserved after importing to oVirt.   <br><br>Reason: <br><br>Unless the user specifically specifies pre-allocation, the Disk Size of the Virtual Machine should be no larger than required during initial allocation of Disk Space when the VM is running. Previously when choosing Thin Provisioning for KVM to oVirt Importing, the Disk Size of the VM within the Storage Domain of oVirt was inflated to the Volume Size or Larger when the original KVM VM was much smaller.  <br><br>Result: <br><br>Now when Importing Virtual Machines from KVM to oVirt with Thin Provisioning selected, the original Disk Size of the VM is preserved.
 - [BZ 1510856](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1510856) <b>[RFE] Time sync in VM after resuming from PAUSE state</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Added optional Guest Time Synchronization to the snapshot functionality via the time_sync_snapshot_enable option and other un-pausing scenarios via the time_sync_cont_enable option for synchronizing and correcting the time on the VM after long pauses. The defaults for the option are turned off for backward compatibility.<br><br>Reason: <br><br>This becomes especially critical when there are heavy loads on the VM to ensure time stamps for example are accurate.<br><br>Result: <br><br>When the options are enabled, the VDSM shall attempt to synchronize the time either during pauses that occur via during snapshots and/or during other un-pausing functionality.
 - [BZ 1451297](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1451297) <b>[RFE] Drop TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 encryption protocols support</b><br>TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols are no longer secure, so they are forcefully disabled in VDSM configuration and cannot no longer be enabled within configuration.<br><br>Only TLSv1.2 and higher version of protocols are enabled, exact versions depends on underlying openssl version.

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1644693](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1644693) <b>High Host CPU load for Windows 10 Guests (Update 1803)  when idle</b><br>Feature: Added enlightenment support in order to reduce CPU load by enabling the hyper-visor synic and stimer states.  <br><br>Reason: To improve performance when running Windows as a guest OS.<br><br>Result: Anticipated results are that CPU load will be reduced to 0-5% on Linux Virtual Machines.
 - [BZ 1661921](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1661921) <b>ovirt-provider-ovn TLS hardening (Default use of TLSv1.2 and HIGH ciphers only)</b><br>Feature: <br> - internal OVN db connections are encrypted by TLS 1.2 with 'HIGH' chiphers in<br>   new RHV 4.3 installations by default<br> - Ciphers used on ovirt-provider's OpenStack REST API are configurable<br><br>Reason: <br> - bug 1459441 enables RHV to configure the encryption of OVN internal connections<br> - default OpenSSL config in RHEL 7 allows usage of insecure ciphers<br><br>Result: <br> - in RHV 4.3 default config internal OVN connections and<br>   ovirt-provider's OpenStack REST API uses TLS 1.2 and HIGH ciphers.
 - [BZ 1571371](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1571371) <b>[RFE] Allow pinning a VM (specifically high-performance) with vNUMA to more than one host</b><br>Feature: A VM with NUMA pinning enabled can now be configured to run on a set of assigned/pinned hosts (one or more).<br><br>Reason: Up till now there was a limitation that only one host (and not more than one) can be assigned to a VM, in case of NUMA nodes pinning is enabled.<br><br>Result: A VM with NUMA pinning enabled can now be configured to run on a set of assigned/pinned hosts, one or more (by selecting the "Start running on: Specific Host" in "Host" side-tab). <br>Each one of this hosts should have the same pinning settings so that VM can run on each and this is verified by the engine.<br>This change is crucial for supporting High Availability for those VMs.
 - [BZ 1641125](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1641125) <b>[RFE] add a configuration policy for vGPU placement</b><br>It is now possible to set in host configuration preferred vGPU placement on physical cards. Separated placement prefers putting each vGPU on a separate physical card, consolidated placement prefers putting more vGPUs on available physical cards.
 - [BZ 1539829](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1539829) <b>[RFE] Provide support for adding security groups and rules using ovirt-provider-ovn</b><br>This feature provides security group support, as described by the OpenStack Networking API.
 - [BZ 1619210](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1619210) <b>[RFE] Provide Live Migration for VMs based on "High Performance VM" Profile - automatic migrations</b><br>Feature: <br>This feature provides the ability to enable live migration for HP VMs (and in general to all VM types with pinning settings).<br><br>Reason: <br>n oVirt 4.2 we added a new “High Performance” VM profile type. This required configuration settings includes pinning the VM to a host based on the host specific configuration. Due to that pinning settings, the migration option for the HP VM type was automatically forced to be disabled.<br><br>Result: <br>in oVirt 4.3 we will provide the ability for live migration of HP VMs (and all other VMs with pinned configuration like NUMA pinning, CPU pinning and CPU pass-through enabled). <br><br>For more details, please refer to the feature page: <br>https://ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/virt/high-performance-vm-migration.html
 - [BZ 1648190](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1648190) <b>[RHEL76] libvirt is unable to start after upgrade due to malformed UTCTIME values in cacert.pem, because properly renewed CA certificate was not passed to hosts by executing "Enroll certificate" or "Reinstall"</b><br>Internal CAs generated in the past (<= 3.5) can contain UTCTIME values without timezone indication and this is not acceptable anymore with up to date openssl and gnutls libraries.<br>engine-setup was already checking it proposing a remediation but the user can postpone it, making it more evident since now postponing can cause serious issues.
 - [BZ 1111783](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1111783) <b>[RFE][TestOnly] Provide SCSI reservation support for virtio-scsi via rhev-guest-tools for win-8 and win-2012 guests using Direct-Lun as disks</b><br>With this release Windows clustering is supported for iSCSI based direct attached LUNs.
 - [BZ 1598391](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1598391) <b>[RFE] - Certify OSP 14 with OVN as an external network provider on RHV 4.3</b><br>Neutron from OSP 14 configured to use OVN can be used as an external network provider on RHV 4.3 with the limitation described in bug 1655906 .
 - [BZ 1327846](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1327846) <b>[RFE] Q35: Support booting virtual machines via UEFI</b><br>
 - [BZ 1590202](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1590202) <b>[RFE] Disable Event notification popup in admin portal</b><br>This adds a feature to control toast notifications. Once 3 or more notifications are showing, "Dismiss" and "Do not disturb" buttons will appear that allow the user to silence notifications.
 - [BZ 1571399](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1571399) <b>[RFE] Improve UI plugin API for adding action buttons</b><br>Feature: When adding custom action buttons (located above main or details tab grid) via UI plugin API, it's now possible to specify the relative position of the button and whether it should be placed in the "more" menu.<br><br>Reason: Give UI plugins more control over plugin-contributed action button placement.<br><br>Result: When calling addMenuPlaceActionButton/addDetailPlaceActionButton API functions, you can now pass "index" and "moreMenu" options to customize the relative position of the button and whether it should be placed in the "more" menu. By default, the button will be placed at the end (after all existing buttons) and outside the "more" menu.
 - [BZ 1527860](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1527860) <b>[RFE] Q35: change piix3-usb controller (USB1) to qemu-xhci controller (USB3)</b><br>Feature: Adding USB qemu-xhci controller support to SPICE consoles.<br><br>Reason: For Q35 chipset support<br><br>Result: We expect when a Bios type using the Q35 chipset is chosen and usb is enabled that the USB controller shall be qemu-xhci.
 - [BZ 1611889](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1611889) <b>Switch from ENI to OMP dumps network config to different file and breaks EL6 guests</b><br>Feature: Allow the user to select the cloud init protocol with which to create the network configuration for the VM<br><br>Reason: in odler versions of cloud-init, backward compatibility needs to be maintained with the ENI protocol whereas on newer cloud-init versions the Openstack-Metadata protocol is supported.<br><br>Result: engine now supports selection of the cloud-init protocol to use as part of the cloud-init parameter entry form, while creating a new VM or editing an existing one or starting a VM with Run Once.
 - [BZ 1388098](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1388098) <b>[RFE] Prevent RHV-M from restarting hosts during large outage</b><br>
 - [BZ 1630243](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1630243) <b>[RFE] Show live migration progress bar also in virtual machine tab in host page</b><br>During VM live migration, the migration progress bar is shown also in the host page on the virtual machine tab.
 - [BZ 1559694](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1559694) <b>RFE: warn user if VM does not fit in a single numa node of the host</b><br>If a VM does not use virtual NUMA nodes, it is better if its whole memory can fit into a single NUMA node on the host. Otherwise, there may be some performance overhead.<br><br>There are two additions in this RFE:<br>1. New warning message is shown in the audit log, if a VM is run on a host where its memory cannot fit to a single host NUMA node.<br><br>2. A new policy unit is added to the scheduler, 'Fit VM to single host NUMA node'. When starting a VM, this policy prefers hosts where the VM can fit to a single NUMA node. This unit is not active by default, because it can cause undesired edge cases.<br><br>For example, the policy unit would cause the following behavior when starting multiple VMs.<br>It the following setup:<br>- 9 hosts with 16 GB per NUMA node<br>- 1 host with 4 GB per NUMA node<br><br>When multiple VMs with 6 GB of memory are scheduled, the scheduling unit would prevent them from starting on the host with 4 GB per NUMA node. No matter how overloaded the other hosts are. It would use the last host only when all the others does not have enough free memory to run the VM.
 - [BZ 1009608](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1009608) <b>[RFE] Limit east-west traffic of VMs with network filter</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Limit east-west traffic of VMs. <br><br>Reason: <br><br>To enable traffic only between VM and gateway. <br><br>Result: <br><br>The new filter 'clean-traffic-gateway' has been added to libvirt. With parameter called 'GATEWAY_MAC' user can specify MAC address of gateway that is allowed to communicate with the VM and vice versa. Please note that user can specify multiple 'GATEWAY_MAC'. <br><br>There are two possible configurations of VM:<br><br>1) VM with static IP<br><br>This is recommended setup. It is also recommended setting of parameter 'CTRL_IP_LEARNING' to 'none', any other value will result in leak of initial traffic. This is caused by libvirt learning mechanism (see https://libvirt.org/formatnwfilter.html#nwfelemsRulesAdvIPAddrDetection and https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1647944 for more details).<br><br>2) VM with DHCP<br><br>DHCP is working partially. It is not usable in production currently (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651499).<br><br><br>The filter has general issue with ARP leak (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651467). Peer VMs are able to see that the VM using this feature exists (in their arp table), but are not able to contact the VM, as the traffic from peers is still blocked by the filter.
 - [BZ 1454673](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1454673) <b>[RFE] Changes that require Virtual Machine restart: name</b><br>Feature: <br>When a request to rename a virtual machine arrives, change the name of the virtual machine immediately also when the QEMU process is running and is set with the previous name.<br><br>Reason: <br>Users typically want to see and use the new name a virtual machine is set with even when it is running.<br><br>Result: <br>When renaming a running virtual machine, the new name is applied immediately. In this case, the user is provided with a warning that indicates that the running instance of the virtual machine uses the previous name.
 - [BZ 1553902](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1553902) <b>[RFE] Update UI plugin API to reflect current UI design</b><br>Starting with oVirt 4.3, the UI plugin API is updated to reflect recent web administration UI design changes.<br><br>In general, there are two types of changes:<br><br>(1) new API functions:<br>- addPrimaryMenuContainer & addSecondaryMenuPlace that allow plugins to add custom secondary menu items to the vertical navigation menu<br><br>(2) renaming of existing API functions:<br>- addMainTab => addPrimaryMenuPlace<br>- addSubTab => addDetailPlace<br>- setTabContentUrl => setPlaceContentUrl<br>- setTabAccessible => setPlaceAccessible<br>- addMainTabActionButton => addMenuPlaceActionButton<br>- addSubTabActionButton => addDetailPlaceActionButton<br><br>The reason for renaming API functions (2) is to stay consistent with current web administration UI design - most notably, the absence of "main" and "sub" tabs.<br><br>All existing API functions are still supported. For API functions that were renamed (2), it's still possible to use the original ones, but doing so will yield a warning in the browser console, for example:<br><br>"addMainTab is deprecated, please use addPrimaryMenuPlace instead."<br><br>Additionally, for functions [addPrimaryMenuPlace, addPrimaryMenuContainer, addSecondaryMenuPlace, addDetailPlace] and their deprecated equivalents, the options object no longer supports alignRight (boolean) parameter. This is because PatternFly tabs widget [1] expects all tabs to be aligned next to each other, flowing from left to right.<br><br>[1] http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/widgets/#tabs<br><br>For details, please consult the oVirt UI plugins feature page.
 - [BZ 1518697](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1518697) <b>engine-setup upgrade of postgres to pg95 env variables not stored to answer file</b><br>engine-setup now uses otopi's new functionality to generate its answer files, which should automatically cover all future added questions without requiring specific code for handling them. The option '--config-append' is compatible with both kinds of files, although the actual behavior will be somewhat different.
 - [BZ 1286219](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1286219) <b>[RFE] Disk alias of cloned VM should be Alias_<Cloned-VM-Name></b><br>Feature: <br>Change the disk alias of cloned VM.<br><br>Reason:<br>Disk alias of cloned VM should be Alias_<Cloned-VM-Name>. <br><br>Result:<br>After cloning a VM, its disks are named as <br>Alias_<Cloned-VM-Name>.
 - [BZ 1540921](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1540921) <b>[RFE] Deprecate and remove support for Conroe and Penryn CPUs</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Deprecated Conroe and Penryn CPU Types from Compatibility Version 4.3<br><br>Reason: <br><br>We no longer want to support them.<br><br><br>Result: <br><br>Conroe and Penryn CPU Types no longer appear for Compatibility Version 4.3 and a warning is displayed for older versions.

 - [BZ 1560132](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1560132) <b>[RFE] Add finer grained monitoring thresholds for memory consumption on Hypervisors to RHV</b><br>In the Administration Portal, it is possible to set a threshold for cluster level monitoring as a percentage or an absolute value, for example, 95% or 2048 MB. When usage exceeds 95% or free memory falls below 2048 MB, a "high memory usage" or "low memory available" event is logged. This reduces log clutter for clusters with large (1.5 TB) amounts of memory.
