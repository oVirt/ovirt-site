### What is a wiki?

A wiki is a website where any visitor with sufficient permissions can change the web pages, by editing them in place using a very simple syntax. To protect this website against "spam" edits, users are required to create an account and authenticate their email address before making edits to pages. In addition, a small number of pages - [ the front page](Home), [Download](Download), [Documentation](Documentation), [Community](Community) and [Develop](Develop) are protected - which means that only site admins may edit them.
