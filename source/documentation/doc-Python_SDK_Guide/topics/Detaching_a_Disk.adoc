import ovirtsdk4 as sdk
import ovirtsdk4.types as types

connection = sdk.Connection(
    url='https://engine.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
    username='admin@internal',
    password='password',
    ca_file='ca.pem',
)

# Get the reference to the "vms" service:
vms_service = connection.system_service().vms_service()

# Find the virtual machine:
vm = vms_service.list(search='name=vm1')[0]

# Locate the service that manages the virtual machine:
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)

attachments_service = vm_service.disk_attachments_service()
attachment = next(
    (a for a in disk_attachments if a.disk.id == disk.id), None
)

# Remove the attachment. The default behavior is that the disk is detached
# from the virtual machine, but not deleted from the system. If you wish to
# delete the disk, change the detach_only parameter to "False".
attachment.remove(detach_only=True)

print("Detached disk %s successfully!" % attachment)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()

If the `delete` or `remove` request is successful, the examples output the text:

[source,terminal]
----
Detached disk vm1_disk1 successfully!
