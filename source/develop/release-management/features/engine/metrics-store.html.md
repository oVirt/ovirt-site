## Description

[![oVirt Metrics Store Architecture](/images/wiki/MetricsStoreArchitecture.jpg)](images/wiki/MetricsStoreArchitecture.jpg)

In 4.1, Collectd will be already installed and configured on the hosts.
We plan to further integrate it with external tools to collect, aggregate and visualize metrics and logs.

In the next version, Collectd will be installed and configured with the engine as well.

We also plan on adding Aletring that will detect and notify the user in case something goes wrong in his environment,
based on SLA events, thresholds etc.
