# oVirt 4.2.7 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.2.7 release as of November 02, 2018.

Release has been updated on November 13, 2018..

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5,
CentOS Linux 7.5 (or similar).



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.2.7, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### No Fedora support

Regretfully, Fedora is not supported anymore, and RPMs for it are not provided.
These are still built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
At this point, we only try to fix problems specific to Fedora if they affect
developers. For some of the work to be done to restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## What's New in 4.2.7?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1632592](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1632592) <b>Upgrade ovirt-engine-wildfly to 14.0.1 Final</b><br>This is upstream oVirt release notes only:<br><br>oVirt 4.2.7 requires WildFly 14, which is provided by ovirt-engine-wildfly and ovirt-engine-wildfly-overlay packages. The upgrade from WildFly 13 to 14 is automatic and it's performed during oVirt engine upgrade from 4.1.z/4.2.z to 4.2.7+

#### oVirt Engine WildFly

 - [BZ 1632592](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1632592) <b>Upgrade ovirt-engine-wildfly to 14.0.1 Final</b><br>This is upstream oVirt release notes only:<br><br>oVirt 4.2.7 requires WildFly 14, which is provided by ovirt-engine-wildfly and ovirt-engine-wildfly-overlay packages. The upgrade from WildFly 13 to 14 is automatic and it's performed during oVirt engine upgrade from 4.1.z/4.2.z to 4.2.7+

### Enhancements

#### imgbased

 - [BZ 1613931](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1613931) <b>[RFE] Add the ability to recover from failed upgrades</b><br>This release adds the recover verb to imgbase. While upgrading ovirt-node-ng, imgbase creates LVs. If for any reason imgbase fails, and those LVs remain on the system, rerunning the upgrade fails on "existing LVs".<br>Now, `imgbase --experimental recover` finds and removes stale LVs that remained on the system due to a failed upgrade. imgbase will prompt the user before removing LVs, unless used with --force.

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1590967](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1590967) <b>[RFE] Display space savings when a VDO volume is used.</b><br>The current release has a 'VDO Savings' field that displays the savings percentage for the Gluster Storage Domain, Volume, and Brick views.
 - [BZ 1623259](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1623259) <b>Mark clusters with deprecated CPU type</b><br>In the current release, for compatibility versions 4.2 and 4.3, a warning in the Cluster screen indicates that the CPU types currently used are not supported in 4.3. The warning enables the user to change the cluster CPU type to a supported CPU type.
 - [BZ 1610979](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1610979) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.7] [RHEL-7.6] Limit east-west traffic of VMs with network filter</b><br>In the current release, a filter for VNIC profiles, `clean-traffic-gateway`, supports private VLAN connections.

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1628477](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1628477) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.7] After importing KVM VM the actual size is bigger than the virtual size</b><br>When a VM is running, the disk size of the virtual machine should be no larger than was required during the initial allocation of disk space, unless you specify pre-allocation. Previously, when you set thin provisioning for importing a KVM-based VM into a Red Hat Virtualizaton environment, the disk size of the VM within the Red Hat Virtualization storage domain was inflated to the volume size or larger, even when the original KVM-based VM was much smaller.<br>KVM Sparseness is now supported so that when you import a virtual machine with thin provisioning enabled into a Red Hat Virtualization environment, the disk size of the original virtual machine image is preserved.
 - [BZ 1620573](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1620573) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.7] [RFE] Time sync in VM after resuming from PAUSE state</b><br>Large snapshots can result in long pauses of a VM that can affect the accuracy of the System Time, upon which time stamps and other time related functions depend. Guest Time Synchronization enables synchronization of the VM’s System Time during the creation of snapshots when enabled. When this feature is enabled and the Guest Agent is running, the VDSM process on the Host attempts to synchronize the System Time of the VM with the Host’s System Time when snapshots are completed and the VM is un-paused. To turn on Guest Time Synchronization for snapshots, use the time_sync_snapshot_enable option. For synchronizing the VM’s System Time during abnormal scenarios that may cause the VM to pause, you can enable the time_sync_cont_enable option. By default, these features are disabled for backward compatibility.
 - [BZ 1621211](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1621211) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.7] qemu-img: slow disk move/clone/import</b><br>Copying volumes to preallocated disks is slower than it can be, and does not make optimal use of available network resources. In this release, qemu-img uses out of order writing. As a result, write operations, such as importing, moving or copying large disks to preallocated storage, can be up to 6 times faster.

#### oVirt Log Collector

 - [BZ 1620271](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1620271) <b>enable rhv_analyzer plugin for sos >= 3.6</b><br>The ovirt-log-collector now includes the RHV Log Collector Analyzer report. This analysis is generated by the rhv-log-collector-analyzer tool, which analyzes the RHV environment and detects anomalies in the system.

#### oVirt Windows Guest Tools

 - [BZ 1637534](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1637534) <b>[downstream clone - 4.2.7] Include linux qemu-guest-agent on RHV Guest Tools iso for v2v offline conversion</b><br>QEMU Guest Agent packages for several Linux distributions have been added to ease offline installation of the guest agent.
