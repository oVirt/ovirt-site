[[Configuring_timezones]]
= Configuring the time zone

{virt-product-fullname} stores time zone configurations for virtual machines in `/etc/ovirt-engine/conf/00-timezone.properties`. This file contains default time zone values such as `Etc/GMT=Greenwich Standard Time`. It features mappings that are valid for Windows and non-Windows time zones.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not edit the actual `00-timezone.properties` file. Changes will be overwritten if you upgrade or restore the {engine-name}.

Do not change values that come directly from the operating system or the {engine-name}.
====

.Procedure
. Create an override file in `/etc/ovirt-engine/conf/`. The file name must begin with a value greater than `00`, so that the file appears after `/etc/ovirt-engine/conf/00-timezone.properties`, and ends with the extension, `.properties`.
+
For example, `10-timezone.properties` overrides the default file, `00-timezone.properties`. The last file in the file list has precedence over earlier files.
. Add new time zones to that file. Be sure each key is a valid General time zone from the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[time zone database] and the value is a valid Windows time zone:
+
General:: Time zones used for non-Windows operating system types, must follow the standard time zone format for example, `Etc/GMT` or `Asia/Jerusalem`.
Windows:: Time zones specifically supported on link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms912391(v=winembedded.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN[Windows] for example, `GMT Standard Time` or `Israel Standard Time`.
. Restart the `{engine-package}` service:
