# Responding to wiki account requests

## Response to people who haven't confirmed their email addresses

    Hello:

    When you made this account request you should have received an email asking you to confirm your email address.

    We require this for wiki editors/writers. Can you please respond to that email? Then we can approve your account.

    Thank you - wiki admins
