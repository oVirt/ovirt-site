When taking a backup of a running virtual machine, the process creates a scratch disk on the same storage domain as the disk being backed up. The backup process creates this disk to enable new data to be written to the running virtual machine during the backup. You can see this scratch disk in the Administration Portal during the backup. It is automatically deleted when the backup finishes.
