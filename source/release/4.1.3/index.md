# oVirt 4.1.3 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of 4.1.3
Release as
of July 06, 2017.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3,
CentOS Linux 7.3 (or similar).
Packages for Fedora 24 are also available as a Tech Preview.



For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.1.3, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL



In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/)


If you're upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need
to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup



### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/)

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/)

### EPEL

TL;DR Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the epel repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS OpsTools SIG repos, for other packages.

EPEL currently includes collectd 5.7.1, and the collectd package there includes
the write_http plugin.

OpsTools currently includes collectd 5.7.0, and the write_http plugin is
packaged separately.

ovirt-release does not use collectd from epel, so if you only use it, you
should be ok.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to not
include collectd. Either use `includepkgs` and add those you need, or use
`exclude=collectd*`.


## What's New in 4.1.3?

### Deprecated Functionality

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1441632](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1441632) <b>Hide "advanced" migration option a bit better</b><br>With this update, the migration of a virtual machine to a different cluster can no longer be invoked from the UI. Regular migration within a cluster remains unchanged.

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine SDK 4 Python

 - [BZ 1436981](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1436981) <b>[RFE] Add support for asynchronous requests and pipe-lining</b><br>The Python SDK now support asynchronous requests and HTTP pipe-lining. Users can now send requests asynchronously and wait for the response later in code. This makes it possible to send multiple request using multiple connections or pipelined connections, and wait for the response later, which improves performance when fetching multiple objects from the API.

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1444992](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1444992) <b>[RFE] Provide hook for vGPU</b><br>This update adds a new VDSM hook called vdsm-hook-vfio-mdev that makes the host capable of working with mdev capable devices such as GPUs. The hook is automatically installed. The following prerequisites apply for a virtual machine to use a mdev instance: <br>1) The host must have a kernel that supports mediated device, have the device and the correct drivers. <br>2) The predefined property, 'mdev_type', must be set and correspond to one of the mdev types supported by the device. <br>3) The virtual machine must be pinned to the host(s) with the device(s). <br><br>The supported mdev_type values can be determined by checking the host on which the device is present (not visible in the engine) by querying vdsm (vdsm-client Host hostdevListByCaps) or running the following bash script:<br><br>for device in /sys/class/mdev_bus/*; do<br>  for mdev_type in $device/mdev_supported_types/*; do<br>    MDEV_TYPE=$(basename $mdev_type)<br>    DESCRIPTION=$(cat $mdev_type/description)<br>    echo "mdev_type: $MDEV_TYPE --- description: $DESCRIPTION";<br>  done;<br>done | sort | uniq
 - [BZ 1432912](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1432912) <b>[RFE] add search query for "next run configuration exists"</b><br>It is now possible to search for VMs that have pending configuration changes. The search query is "Vms: next_run_configuration_exists=True"
 - [BZ 1426905](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1426905) <b>[Metrics Store] Install fluent-plugin-viaq_data_model plugin on engine machine</b><br>
 - [BZ 1431545](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1431545) <b>[RFE] remove the webadmin/userportal debuginfo packages and have automatic deobfuscation</b><br>With this update, GWT symbol maps, used to clarify obfuscated client-side (GWT UI) stack traces (/var/log/ovirt-engine/ui.log), are now part of the core Red Hat Virtualization Manager UI packages. The packages are installed by default when the Red Hat Virtualization Manager is installed or upgraded.<br><br>This update means that the user now has meaningful client-side stack traces in /var/log/ovirt-engine/ui.log without having to install additional packages, which saves time when analyzing UI related issues. This update also reduces the symbol maps size by zipping them. The Administration Portal UI uncompressed GWT symbol maps previously took ~1 GB of disk space. The zipped version consumes only 50 MB. The content of the zipped GWT symbol map files is streamed by the Manager as required and the content is not physically extracted to disk. After the Manager install or upgrade, the GWT symbol maps files use the following location:<br><br>/usr/share/ovirt-engine/gwt-symbols/webadmin/symbolMaps.zip<br><br>NOTE: The webadmin-portal-debuginfo package, which previously provided the GWT symbol map files, must now be manually removed prior to engine upgrade, or the upgrade will fail. (This package is an optional install, so you only need to remove it if you've manually installed it.)
 - [BZ 1421204](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1421204) <b>Allow TLSv1.2 during protocol negotiation for external provider communication</b><br>Previous versions of Red Hat Virtualization were able to negotiate encryption protocol up to TLSv1 for external provider communication. This update adds the the ability to negotiate encryption protocol up to TLSv1.2.<br><br>Note: The exact version used for communication depends on highest version available on the external provider target.

#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1022961](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1022961) <b>Gluster: running a VM from a gluster domain should use gluster URI instead of a fuse mount</b><br>
 - [BZ 1444992](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1444992) <b>[RFE] Provide hook for vGPU</b><br>This update adds a new VDSM hook called vdsm-hook-vfio-mdev that makes the host capable of working with mdev capable devices such as GPUs. The hook is automatically installed. The following prerequisites apply for a virtual machine to use a mdev instance: <br>1) The host must have a kernel that supports mediated device, have the device and the correct drivers. <br>2) The predefined property, 'mdev_type', must be set and correspond to one of the mdev types supported by the device. <br>3) The virtual machine must be pinned to the host(s) with the device(s). <br><br>The supported mdev_type values can be determined by checking the host on which the device is present (not visible in the engine) by querying vdsm (vdsm-client Host hostdevListByCaps) or running the following bash script:<br><br>for device in /sys/class/mdev_bus/*; do<br>  for mdev_type in $device/mdev_supported_types/*; do<br>    MDEV_TYPE=$(basename $mdev_type)<br>    DESCRIPTION=$(cat $mdev_type/description)<br>    echo "mdev_type: $MDEV_TYPE --- description: $DESCRIPTION";<br>  done;<br>done | sort | uniq
 - [BZ 1450646](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1450646) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.3] "libvirt chain" message is not displayed in the vdsm logs by default during a live merge</b><br>This update makes it easier to debug a disk snapshot's live deletion failures because the initial state of the volume chain is logged.

#### oVirt Hosted Engine Setup

 - [BZ 1439281](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1439281) <b>Upgrading procedures hardcodes  admin@internal</b><br>The self-hosted engine Manager virtual machine upgrade procedure from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.6 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 now always tries to connect to the Manager API as admin@internal, making it more flexible.
 - [BZ 1426898](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1426898) <b>[Metrics Store] Include fluent-plugin-viaq_data_model in base node image</b><br>
 - [BZ 1426897](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1426897) <b>[Metrics Store] add fluent-plugin-collectd-nest to ovirt-hosted-engine-setup dependencies</b><br>

#### imgbased

 - [BZ 1368420](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1368420) <b>[RFE] Improve update speed</b><br>

#### oVirt Log collector

 - [BZ 1455771](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1455771) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.3] [RFE] Log collector should collect time diff for all hosts</b><br>When collecting SOS reports from hosts, chrony and systemd SOS plugins can collect information about time synchronization. In addition, a new option --time-only has been added to ovirt-log-collector allowing information about time differences to be gathered from the hosts without gathering full SOS reports, saving a considerable amount of time for the operation.

#### oVirt Engine Metrics

 - [BZ 1429861](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1429861) <b>[RFE] Pass engine database credentials for postgresql collectd plugin</b><br>With this update, ovirt-engine-metrics can now configure collectd to connect to the Red Hat Virtualization Manager's postgresql database and get information from it. Previously, making collectd connect to the postgresql database did not work and was disabled by BZ#1436001.
 - [BZ 1418659](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1418659) <b>[RFE] Add fluentd configuration for parsing engine.log</b><br>With this update, engine.log has been added to the logs collection. The records are now parsed and sent to the central metrics store. This allows the administrator to analyse the logs in a more simple and comfortable way. This means that the engine.log records are available for analysis in Kibana.
 - [BZ 1434575](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1434575) <b>[RFE] Update engine and hosts fluentd configurations to use rubygem-fluent-plugin-collectd-nest</b><br>

#### oVirt Host Deploy

 - [BZ 1426903](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1426903) <b>[Metrics Store] Install fluent-plugin-collectd-nest with Fluentd</b><br>

### Known Issue

#### imgbased

 - [BZ 1455441](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1455441) <b>[downstream clone - 4.1.3] HostedEngine setup fails if RHV-H timezone < UTC set during installation</b><br>Previously, the self-hosted engine setup failed if the system clock was set to a time zone that was behind UTC during the installation. This is due to the fact that the Red Hat Virtualization Host generates VDSM certificates at the first boot and if the clock is incorrect, the chronyd or ntpd processes resynchronized the clock. This lead to an invalid certificate if the time zone was behind UTC.<br><br>Now, Red Hat Virtualization Host generates the certificates after the chronyd or ntpd processes, and waits two seconds for the clock to synchronize.<br><br>Note that if the Red Hat Virtualization Host is configured after the installation, or if the NTP server is too slow, the self-hosted engine setup may fail.
