= Dependencies

To use the Java software development kit in Java applications, you must add the following JAR files to the class path of those applications:

* *commons-beanutils.jar*

* *commons-codec.jar*

* *httpclient.jar*

* *httpcore.jar*

* *jakarta-commons-logging.jar*

* *log4j.jar*

The packages that provide these JAR files are installed as dependencies to the `ovirt-engine-sdk-java` package. By default, they are available in the */usr/share/java* directory on {enterprise-linux} 6 and {enterprise-linux} 7 systems.
