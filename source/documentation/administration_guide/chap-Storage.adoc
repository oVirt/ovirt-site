== Preparing and adding local storage

A virtual machine's disk that uses a storage device that is physically installed on the virtual machine's host is referred to as a local storage device.

A storage device must be part of a storage domain. The storage domain type for local storage is referred to as a local storage domain.

Configuring a host to use local storage automatically creates, and adds the host to, a new local storage domain, data center and cluster to which no other host can be added. Multiple-host clusters require that all hosts have access to all storage domains, which is not possible with local storage. Virtual machines created in a single-host cluster cannot be migrated, fenced, or scheduled.
