|UserRole |Can access and use virtual machines and pools. |Can log in to the VM Portal and use virtual machines and pools.
|PowerUserRole |Can create and manage virtual machines and templates. |Apply this role to a user for the whole environment with the *Configure* window, or for specific data centers or clusters.

Having a *PowerUserRole* is equivalent to having the *VmCreator*, *DiskCreator*, and *TemplateCreator* roles.

|UserTemplateBasedVm |Limited privileges to only use Templates. |Level of privilege to create a virtual machine by means of a template.
|VmCreator |Can create virtual machines in the VM Portal. |This role is not applied to a specific virtual machine; apply this role to a user for the whole environment with the *Configure* window. When applying this role to a cluster, you must also apply the *DiskCreator* role on an entire data center, or on specific storage domains.
|VnicProfileUser |Logical network and network interface user for virtual machines. |If the *Allow all users to use this Network* option was selected when a logical network is created, *VnicProfileUser* permissions are assigned to all users for the logical network. Users can then attach or detach virtual machine network interfaces to or from the logical network.
