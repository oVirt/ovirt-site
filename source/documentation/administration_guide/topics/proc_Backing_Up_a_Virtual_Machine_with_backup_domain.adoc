= Backing up or Restoring a Virtual Machine or Snapshot Using a Backup Domain

You can back up a powered down virtual machine or snapshot. You can then store the backup on the same data center and restore it as needed, or migrate it to another data center.

.Procedure: Backing Up a Virtual Machine

. Create a backup domain. See xref:Setting_a_storage_domain_to_be_a_backup_domain_backup_domain[].

. Create a new virtual machine based on the virtual machine you want to back up:

 * To back up a snapshot, first create a virtual machine from a snapshot. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}virtual_machine_management_guide/[Creating a Virtual Machine from a Snapshot] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.
 * To back up a virtual machine, first clone the virtual machine. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}virtual_machine_management_guide/[Cloning a Virtual Machine] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_. Make sure the clone is powered down before proceeding.
. Export the new virtual machine to a backup domain. See link:{URL_virt_product_docs}virtual_machine_management_guide/[Exporting a Virtual Machine to a Data Domain] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.

.Procedure: Restoring a Virtual Machine

. Make sure that the backup storage domain that stores the virtual machine backup is attached to a data center.

. Import the virtual machine from the backup domain. See xref:Importing_Virtual_Machines_from_an_Imported_Data_Storage_Domain[].

// * Leave the backup domain attached to the current data center.
