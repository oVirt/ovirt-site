### Detailed Description

This feature covers changes to ovirt-engine, vdsm, and mom to enable a memory ballooning MOM policy at the host or cluster level. For users desiring a high level of VM density even with a risk of degraded performance, an aggressive management policy including memory ballooning is needed. Implementation of this feature can be broken down into the following sub-tasks

*   MOM: Multiple policies support
*   MOM: Per-VM attributes
*   MOM: auto-balloon policy
*   vdsm: API for setting/getting/clearing MOM policies
*   engine: host policy management
*   engine: Policy selection UI

### Benefit to oVirt

oVirt will gain the ability to achieve higher VM densities and more efficient use of host memory resources. This feature also serves as the foundation for a more sophisticated SLA framework that will be developed over time.
