**Basic concepts**

*   achievement is the basic unit of tracking user's progress
*   each achievement maps to one or more feature(s)
*   achievements are organized into different categories (Networking, Storage, etc.)
*   achievement can be in following states:
    -   locked - achievement not completed yet, show mini-guide (hint) on how to unlock it
    -   unlocked - achievement completed, show mini-doc with summary on feature(s) behind it
    -   blocked - completion of this achivement depends on completion of another achievement

**Tracking progress**

*   each achievement has one or more completion condition(s) - tracking progress of given achievement
*   progress = % of achievements unlocked in given category (category progress) or in total (global progress)
*   rank = textual representation of progress (Novice, Master, etc.)

**Advanced concepts**

*   achievements can be organized into levels
