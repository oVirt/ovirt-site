==== Extending the Available Size of a Virtual Disk

You can extend the available size of a virtual disk while the virtual disk is attached to a virtual machine. Resizing a virtual disk does not resize the underlying partitions or file systems on that virtual disk. Use the `fdisk` utility to resize the partitions and file systems as required. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1190213[How to Resize a Partition using fdisk] for more information.


*Extending the Available Size of Virtual Disks*

. Click menu:Compute[Virtual Machines].
. Click a virtual machine name to go to the details view.
. Click the *Disks* tab and select the disk to edit.
. Click btn:[Edit].
. Enter a value in the `Extend size by(GB)` field.
. Click btn:[OK].


The target disk's status becomes `locked` for a short time, during which the drive is resized. When the resizing of the drive is complete, the status of the drive becomes `OK`.
