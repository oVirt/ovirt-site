# oVirt 4.4.6 release planning

The oVirt 4.4.6 code freeze is planned for April 25, 2021.

If no critical issues are discovered while testing this compose it will be released on May 04, 2021.

It has been planned to include in this release the content from this query:
[Bugzilla tickets targeted to 4.4.6](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ALL%20target_milestone%3A%22ovirt-4.4.6%22%20-target_milestone%3A%22ovirt-4.4.6-%22)


# oVirt 4.4.6 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.6 Fifth Release Candidate as of April 22, 2021.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 and
CentOS Linux 8.3 (or similar) and CentOS Stream.

> **NOTE**
>
> Starting from oVirt 4.4.6 both oVirt Node and oVirt Engine Appliance are
> based on CentOS Stream.

To find out how to interact with oVirt developers and users and ask questions,
visit our [community page](/community/).
All issues or bugs should be reported via
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).

The oVirt Project makes no guarantees as to its suitability or usefulness.
This pre-release should not to be used in production, and it is not feature
complete.


If you'd like to try oVirt as quickly as possible, follow the instructions on
the [Download](/download/) page.

For complete installation, administration, and usage instructions, see
the [oVirt Documentation](/documentation/).

For a general overview of oVirt, read the [About oVirt](/community/about.html)
page.

To learn about features introduced before 4.4.6, see the
[release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#latest-release-notes).

## RELEASE CANDIDATE

In order to install this Release Candidate you will need to enable pre-release repository.

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release44-pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release44-pre.rpm)


## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.6 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.6 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.6).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.6?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1917874](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1917874) **[RFE] Add Resource size to Hosts/Virtual Machine Uptime panels**

   Add Resource size to Hosts/Virtual Machine Uptime panels:

Hosts Uptime (BR8) panel:

1. CPU Cores

2. Memory Size



Virtual Machine Uptime (BR46) panel:

1. CPU Cores

2. Memory Size

3. Disks Size


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1933672](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1933672) **Ansible security advisory RHSA-2021:0663 not included in RHV**

   RHV 4.4.6 now requires Ansible Engine 2.9.18

 - [BZ 1947403](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1947403) **Increase reboot timeout to 10 min.**

   By default we are waiting a certain amount of time defined by engine-config option ServerRebootTimeout before we consider that a hypervisor finished rebooting. Before oVirt 4.4.6 this timeout has been set to 5 minutes, but from 4.4.6 we are increasing the default to 10 minute. If this is not enough and hypervisors in your setup requires more time to finish rebooting, then please use below commant:



  engine-config -s ServerRebootTimeout=NNN



where NNN is number of seconds which engine waits until it tries to connect to the hypervisor after a reboot. ovirt-engine service needs to be restarted after above change to take effect.

 - [BZ 1926819](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1926819) **python-sdk iscsidiscover return iscsi_targets instead of iscsi_details**

   Host 'iscsi_discover' action has been deprecated.

Host 'discover_iscsi' action has been added to replace it.



The actions do the same thing but have different return values.



'discover_iscsi' returns the information in a 'iscsi_details' element.



'iscsi_discover' returns the information in a 'iscsi_targets' element.



In summary, the action which should be used from now on is 'discover_iscsi'.

 - [BZ 1933974](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1933974) **[RFE] Introduce Datacenter and cluster level 4.6**

   DataCenter and Cluster compatibility level 4.6 is introduced in oVirt Engine 4.4.6. Only hosts running on CentOS/RHEL 8.4 with Advanced Virtualization 8.4 (libvirt &gt;= 7.0.0) can join cluster level 4.6.



New features available in compatibility 4.6 are tracked as separate bugs depending on this bug.


#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1933974](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1933974) **[RFE] Introduce Datacenter and cluster level 4.6**

   DataCenter and Cluster compatibility level 4.6 is introduced in oVirt Engine 4.4.6. Only hosts running on CentOS/RHEL 8.4 with Advanced Virtualization 8.4 (libvirt &gt;= 7.0.0) can join cluster level 4.6.



New features available in compatibility 4.6 are tracked as separate bugs depending on this bug.


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1113630](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1113630) **[RFE] indicate vNICs that are out-of-sync from their configuration on engine**

   

 - [BZ 1944723](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1944723) **[RFE] Support virtual machines with 16TB memory**

   In this version, we support running virtual machines with up to 16TB of RAM on x86_64.

 - [BZ 1669178](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1669178) **[RFE] Q35 SecureBoot - Add ability to preserve variable store certificates.**

   Secure Boot process relies on keys that are normally stored in NVRAM of the VM. However, NVRAM was not stored in previous versions of oVirt and was newly initialized on every start of a VM. This prevented the use of any custom drivers (e.g. for Nvidia devices or for PLDP drivers in SUSE) on VMs with Secure Boot enabled. To be able to use SecureBoot VMs effectively oVirt now persists the content of NVRAM for UEFI VMs.

 - [BZ 1936897](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1936897) **[Engine JDK 11] More verbose and configurable GC logging.**

   Feature: 

More verbose and configurable GC logging. This includes:

1. GC verbose logging disabled by default with INFO verbosity level.



2. Ability to setup desired GC log level via config the property:

ENGINE_VERBOSE_GC_LOG_LEVEL=info

Available options are: off, error, warning, info, debug, trace



3. Ability to setup desired GC log file rotation via:

ENGINE_VERBOSE_GC_LOG_FILE_SIZE=2M  #single log file size

ENGINE_VERBOSE_GC_LOG_FILES_NUMBER=50 #number of files in rotation



Reason: 

oVirt Engine tends to allocate large chunks of memory (depending on overall setup) that might contribute to potential various slow downs caused by Java Garbage Collector operations. 



Result: 

The ability to monitor and discover memory related issues much earlier (before the issue is actually negatively impacting an environment)





In order to customize or disable the above default settings it is recommended to put these properties in one of the engine's etc config ie. /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/99-setup-gc-logging.conf
