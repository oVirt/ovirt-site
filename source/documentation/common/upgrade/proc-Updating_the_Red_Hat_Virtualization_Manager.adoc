Updates to the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} are released through the Content Delivery Network.

.Procedure

ifdef::SHE_upgrade,SHE_minor_updates[. Log in to the {engine-name} virtual machine.]
ifdef::local_database_upgrade,remote_database_upgrade,minor_updates[. Log in to the {engine-name} machine.]

. Check if updated packages are available:
+
----
# engine-upgrade-check
----

. Update the setup packages:
+
ifdef::rhv-doc[]
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# yum update ovirt\\*setup\* rh\*vm-setup-plugins
----
endif::[]
ifdef::ovirt-doc[]
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# yum update ovirt\\*setup\*
----
endif::[]

. Update the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} with the `engine-setup` script. The `engine-setup` script prompts you with some configuration questions, then stops the `ovirt-engine` service, downloads and installs the updated packages, backs up and updates the database, performs post-installation configuration, and starts the `ovirt-engine` service.
+
----
# engine-setup
----
+
When the script completes successfully, the following message appears:
+
----
Execution of setup completed successfully
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `engine-setup` script is also used during the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} installation process, and it stores the configuration values supplied. During an update, the stored values are displayed when previewing the configuration, and might not be up to date if `engine-config` was used to update configuration after installation. For example, if `engine-config` was used to update `SANWipeAfterDelete` to `true` after installation, `engine-setup` will output "Default SAN wipe after delete: False" in the configuration preview. However, the updated values will not be overwritten by `engine-setup`.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The update process might take some time. Do not stop the process before it completes.
====

. Update the base operating system and any optional packages installed on the {engine-name}:
+
----
# yum update
----
+

If the update from {virt-product-shortname} 4.2.7 to {virt-product-shortname} 4.2.8 fails with a message indicating a dependency error with an `eap7-jboss-server-migration-wildfly` package:

. Check if all the required repositories are enabled.
. Update the `eap7-jboss-server-migration-wildfly` packages installed on the Manager:
