[id="Install_collectd_and_rsyslog"]


Deploy `collectd` and `rsyslog` on the hosts to collect logs and metrics.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to repeat this procedure for new hosts. Every new host that is added is automatically configured by the {engine-name} to send the data to Elasticsearch during host-deploy.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {engine-name} machine using SSH.

. Copy `/etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/config.yml.example` to create `/etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/config.yml.d/config.yml`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# cp /etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/config.yml.example /etc/ovirt-engine-metrics/config.yml.d/config.yml
----

. Edit the `ovirt_env_name` and `elasticsearch_host` parameters in `config.yml` and save the file. These parameters are mandatory and are documented in the file. Add the following variables:
+
----
use_omelasticsearch_cert: false
viaq_metrics_store: false
rsyslog_elasticsearch_usehttps_metrics: !!str off
rsyslog_elasticsearch_usehttps_logs: !!str off
----
+
. Deploy `collectd` and `rsyslog` on the hosts:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# /usr/share/ovirt-engine-metrics/setup/ansible/configure_ovirt_machines_for_metrics.sh
----
+
The `configure_ovirt_machines_for_metrics.sh` script runs an Ansible role that includes `linux-system-roles` (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/administration_and_configuration_tasks_using_system_roles_in_rhel/index[Administration and configuration tasks using System Roles in RHEL]) and uses it to deploy and configure `rsyslog` on the host. `rsyslog` collects metrics from `collectd` and sends them to Elasticsearch.
