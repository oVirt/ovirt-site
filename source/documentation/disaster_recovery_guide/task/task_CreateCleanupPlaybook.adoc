= Create the Playbook to Clean the Primary Site

Before you fail back to the primary site, you must ensure that the primary site is cleaned of all storage domains to be imported. You can do so manually on the {engine-name}, or optionally you can create an Ansible playbook to do it for you.

The Ansible playbook to clean the primary site is named `dr-cleanup.yml` in this example, and it uses the mapping file generated by another Ansible playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: clean RHV
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    dr_source_map: primary
  vars_files:
    - disaster_recovery_vars.yml
  roles:
    - oVirt.disaster-recovery
----
