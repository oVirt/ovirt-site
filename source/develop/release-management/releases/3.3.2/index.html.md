# oVirt 3.3.2 release notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.3.2 release

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [oVirt 3.3.1 release notes](oVirt 3.3.1 release notes), [oVirt 3.3 release notes](oVirt 3.3 release notes), [oVirt 3.2 release notes](oVirt 3.2 release notes) and [oVirt 3.1 release notes](oVirt 3.1 release notes). For a general overview of oVirt, read [ the oVirt 3.0 feature guide](oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide) and the [about oVirt](about oVirt) page.

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

If you're installing oVirt 3.3.2 on a clean host you should read our [Quick Start Guide](Quick Start Guide)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you're upgrading from a previous version please update ovirt-release to latest version (10) and ensure you've **ovirt-3.3.2** and **ovirt-stable** repository enabled.

      # yum update ovirt-release
      # yum repolist enabled

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 then you should just execute:

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
      # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade](oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade)

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.1. Please read [oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade](oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade) before starting the upgrade.
On CentOS and RHEL: For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

      [ovirt-32]
      name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
`baseurl=`[`http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/`](http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/)
      enabled=1
      skip_if_unavailable=1
      gpgcheck=0

Then

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup

should install ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.
Then:

      # engine-upgrade

this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just

      # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
      # engine-setup

will upgrade to latest 3.3.

## What's New in 3.3.2?

### VM creation "Guide Me" sequence

The ability to add VM network interfaces has been dropped from the New VM "Guide Me" sequence, as they can now be added/removed directly in the New VM dialog. As always, administrators are encouraged to maintain templates which include networking configurations commonly used in their deployments of oVirt; for special cases, networking should now be configured in the New VM dialog instead of the "Guide Me" sequence.

### Backup and Restore API for Independent Software Vendors

oVirt now provides an API set for Independent Software Vendors to backup and restore virtual machines.
For backup, a snapshot of a virtual machine's disk is created then attached to a virtual appliance.
For restore, disks are attached to a virtual appliance, the data is restored to the disks, then the disks are attached to a virtual machine.

## Known issues

*   EL >= 6.5 or cloud-init >= 0.7.2 are needed for cloud-init feature support ()
*   On Fedora 19 with recent versions of PostgreSQL it may be necessary to manually change kernel.shmmax settings ()
