[[Virtual_Machine_Run_Once_settings_explained]]
=== Explanation of settings in the Run Once window

The *Run Once* window defines one-off boot options for a virtual machine. For persistent boot options, use the *Boot Options* tab in the *New Virtual Machine* window. The *Run Once* window contains multiple sections that can be configured.

The standalone *Rollback this configuration during reboots* check box specifies whether reboots (initiated by the {engine-name}, or from within the guest) will be warm (soft) or cold (hard). Select this check box to configure a cold reboot that restarts the virtual machine with regular (non-*Run Once*) configuration. Clear this check box to configure a warm reboot that retains the virtual machine's *Run Once* configuration.

The *Boot Options* section defines the virtual machine's boot sequence, running options, and source images for installing the operating system and required drivers.

[NOTE]
The following tables do not include information on whether a power cycle is required because these _one-off boot options_ apply only when you reboot the virtual machine.

[[Boot_Options_Fields]]

.Boot Options Section
[cols="1,2", options="header"]

|Field Name
|Description


|*Attach CD*
|Attaches an ISO image to the virtual machine. Use this option to install the virtual machine's operating system and applications. The CD image must reside in the ISO domain.


|*Attach Windows guest tools CD*
|Attaches a secondary virtual CD-ROM to the virtual machine with the virtio-win ISO image.
 Use this option to install Windows drivers. For information on installing the image, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}administration_guide/index#Uploading_the_VirtIO_and_Guest_Tool_Image_Files_to_an_ISO_Storage_Domain[Uploading the VirtIO and Guest Tool Image Files to a Storage Domain] in the _Administration Guide_.

|*Enable menu to select boot device*
|Enables a menu to select the boot device. After the virtual machine starts and connects to the console, but before the virtual machine starts booting, a menu displays that allows you to select the boot device. This option should be enabled before the initial boot to allow you to select the required installation media.


|*Start in Pause Mode*
|Starts and then pauses the virtual machine to enable connection to the console. Suitable for virtual machines in remote locations.


|*Predefined Boot Sequence*
|Determines the order in which the boot devices are used to boot the virtual machine. Select *Hard Disk*, *CD-ROM*, or *Network (PXE)*, and use *Up* and *Down* to move the option up or down in the list.


|*Run Stateless*
|Deletes all data and configuration changes to the virtual machine upon shutdown. This option is only available if a virtual disk is attached to the virtual machine.

The *Linux Boot Options* section contains fields to boot a Linux kernel directly instead of through the BIOS bootloader.

|Field Name
|Description


|*kernel path*
|A fully qualified path to a kernel image to boot the virtual machine. The kernel image must be stored on either the ISO domain (path name in the format of *iso://path-to-image*) or on the host's local storage domain (path name in the format of */data/images*).


|*initrd path*
|A fully qualified path to a ramdisk image to be used with the previously specified kernel. The ramdisk image must be stored on the ISO domain (path name in the format of *iso://path-to-image*) or on the host's local storage domain (path name in the format of */data/images*).


|*kernel parameters*
|Kernel command line parameter strings to be used with the defined kernel on boot.

|===

The *Initial Run* section is used to specify whether to use Cloud-Init or Sysprep to initialize the virtual machine. For Linux-based virtual machines, you must select the *Use Cloud-Init* check box in the *Initial Run* tab to view the available options. For Windows-based virtual machines, you must attach the `[sysprep]` floppy by selecting the *Attach Floppy* check box in the *Boot Options* tab and selecting the floppy from the list.

The options that are available in the *Initial Run* section differ depending on the operating system that the virtual machine is based on.

|menu:Networks[Network]
|Configures network interfaces for the virtual machine. Select this check box and click *\+* or *-* to add or remove network interfaces to or from the virtual machine. When you click *+*, a set of fields becomes visible that can specify whether to use DHCP, and configure an IP address, netmask, and gateway, and specify whether the network interface will start on boot.


|*Custom Script*
|Custom scripts that will be run on the virtual machine when it starts. The scripts entered in this field are custom YAML sections that are added to those produced by the {engine-name}, and allow you to automate tasks such as creating users and files, configuring `yum` repositories and running commands. For more information on the format of scripts that can be entered in this field, see the link:http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html#yaml-examples[Custom Script] documentation.
