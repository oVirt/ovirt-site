## ALPHA RELEASE

In order to install this Alplha Release you will need to enable pre-release repository.

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release44-pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release44-pre.rpm)


## What's New in 4.4.0?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1732738](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1732738) **[RFE] Update engine to use OpenJDK 11 - both build and runtime**

   Modernizing the software stack of ovirt-engine to both compile and runtime using java-11-openjdk.

Java 11 openjdk is the new LTS version from Red Hat so this 

is only a natural step forward.


#### oVirt Release Package

 - [BZ 1745302](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1745302) **ovirt-guest-tools has been obsoleted by virtio-win guest tools**

   oVirt 4.4 replaces the ovirt-guest-tools a with a new WiX-based installer, included in Virtio-Win. You can download the ISO file containing the Windows guest drivers, agents and installers from https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/latest-virtio/


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Setup Lib

 - [BZ 1546838](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1546838) **[RFE] Refuse to deploy on localhost.localdomain**

   Feature:

Warn the user when using 'localhost' as FQDN.



Reason: 

Using 'localhost' as FQDN is not recommended.



Result:

User will be notified when using 'localhost' as FQDN and can choose to keep or change it


#### oVirt Host Dependencies

 - [BZ 1725775](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1725775) **Replace screen requirement with tmux**

   tmux is now installed on hosts instead of screen.

screen has been deprecated in RHEL 7.6 and is not available anymore in RHEL 8.


#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1179273](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1179273) **[RFE] vdsm: Utilize system-wide crypto-policies**

   Feature: Use crypto policies introduced in CentOS 8 in favour of VDSM's local crypto settings



Reason: Using crypto policies provides consistency across the whole OS in regard to crypto standards. Since oVirt solution is composed of multiple projects it is desirable to have a single, easily maintainable way of defining these standards. This is exactly what crypto policies do - they provide a set of configuration files that affect multiple libraries and programming languages to guarantee uniformity, at the same time keeping the used cipher strings, suites and protocols up to date with widely accepted security recommendations.



To find our more about crypto policies, please visit:



https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/consistent-security-crypto-policies-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8



Result: VDSM's 'ssl_protocol', 'ssl_excludes' and 'ssl_ciphers' config options have been removed. If you need to fine-tune your crypto settings you should do it by changing, or creating your own crypto policy. As an example, if you need your hosts to communicate with some legacy systems that still use insecure TLSv1 or TLSv1.1, you can change your crypto policy to 'LEGACY' with: 



 update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY

 - [BZ 1595536](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1595536) **[RFE] Support VMs with VNC console on a FIPS enabled hypervisor**

   When a host is running in FIPS mode, VNC must use SASL authorization instead of regular passwords because of a weak algorithm inherent to the VNC protocol. The current release facilitates using SASL by providing an Ansible role, ovirt-host-setup-vnc-sasl, you can run manually on FIPS-enabled hosts. This role does the following:

* Creates an empty SASL password database.

* Prepares the SASL config file for qemu.

* Changes the libvirt config file for qemu.


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1718818](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1718818) **[RFE] Enhance local disk passthrough**

   

 - [BZ 1767319](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1767319) **[RFE] forbid updating mac pool that contains ranges overlapping with any mac range in the system**

   In this release, modifying a MAC address pool or modifying the range of a MAC address pool that has any overlap with existing MAC address pool ranges, is strictly forbidden.

 - [BZ 1547937](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1547937) **[RFE] Live Storage Migration progress bar.**

   Feature: 

A progress bar indicating the current status of disk synchronization stage of Live Storage Migration was added

Reason: 



Result:

 - [BZ 1593800](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1593800) **[RFE] forbid new mac pools with overlapping ranges**

   When creating a new MAC address pool its ranges must not overlap with each other or with any ranges in existing MAC address pools.

 - [BZ 1700021](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1700021) **[RFE] engine-setup should warn and prompt if ca.pem is missing but other generated pki files exist**

   Previously, engine-setup regenerated all PKI files if ca.pem was not present. Now, if ca.pem is not present but other PKI files are, you can restore ca.pem from backup without regenerating all PKI files. As a result, when a backup is present, you no longer need to reinstall or re-enroll certificates for all hosts.

 - [BZ 1450351](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1450351) **[RFE] Allow specifying a shutdown reason on the .shutdown() call**

   This feature will allow users to set the reason for shutdown/power-off(stop) a VM using REST API request.

 - [BZ 1572155](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1572155) **[RFE] provide VM status and uptime in VM general tab**

   The VM detail, general information tab now contains also VM's status and uptime.

 - [BZ 1325468](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1325468) **[RFE] Autostart of VMs that are down (with Engine assistance - Engine has to be up)**

   

 - [BZ 912723](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/912723) **[RFE] Need to improve the retry mechanism of highly available VMs**

   

 - [BZ 1080097](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1080097) **[RFE] Allow editing disks details in the Disks tab**

   Feature: 

Enable editing floating disks from the UI.

 

Reason: 

Currently, it's possible editing only VM disks (from the VM they attached to).



Result: 

This patch adds a button for editing disks from the 'Disks' tab.

Once the popup shows up, the user will be able to edit a floating disk's properties (such as description and alias) and also to extend its size.

 - [BZ 1652565](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1652565) **[RFE] Unable to edit floating disk**

   Feature: 

Enable editing floating disks from the UI

 

Reason: 

Currently, it's possible editing only VM disks (from the VM they attached to).



Result: 

This patch adds a button for editing disks from the 'Disks' tab.

Once the popup shows up, the user will be able to edit a floating disk's parameters (such as description and alias) and also extends its size.

 - [BZ 854932](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/854932) **RESTAPI: missing update impl at /api/disks/xxx**

   Feature: 

Allows updating disk parameters using the REST-API.



Reason:

Currently, the only parameter that can be updated is the qcow version.



Result:

Now it is possible to edit other parameters (as name, description, shareability, etc), by sending:

PUT /api/disks/xxx

 - [BZ 1574443](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1574443) **[RFE] Allow host to be flipped to maintenance mode in all situations.**

   Feature: 

Allows to put host straight into maintenance mode when doing power management restart (restapi, webadmin).



Reason: 

It is problematic to flip the host to the maintenance state if it is flipping between connecting and activating state. It may get to the non-operation state for short period of time, but one has to monitor the host and click the button as soon as it is in the non-operational state otherwise the host can flip to connecting again.



Result: 

The host, regardless of its initial state before restart, will be put into maintenance mode, skipping connecting & activating phases.

 - [BZ 1306586](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1306586) **change Windows drivers and sysprep delivery method to a CDROM**

   Feature: Replace the floppy device with an additional CDROM device for sysprep installation for Compatibility Versions 4.4 and later. 



Reason: To deprecate floppy support which has resulted in many issues.



Result: An additional CDROM device shall be used to replace the floppy drive for versions 4.4 and later.

 - [BZ 1358501](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1358501) **[RFE] multihost network change - notify when done**

   Feature: Network operations that span multiple hosts will have a start and end event in the events tab and engine.log, and a popup notification for the end of the operation in the web-admin if triggered from the web-admin.



Reason: Network operations that span multiple hosts may take a long time and the user has no indication of when they have finished.



Result:

 - [BZ 1740644](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1740644) **[nmstate] Add config option for Host deployment with nmstate**

   The new configuration option VdsmUseNmstate enables that every host with cluster compatibility level >= 4.4 will be deployed with nmstate.

 - [BZ 1427717](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1427717) **[RFE] Create and/or select affinity group upon VM creation.**

   Feature: 

Select affinity groups when creating or editing a VM or a host.



Reason: 

Previously to add a VM to an affinity group, the user had to navigate to clusters -> cluster details -> affinity groups and edit a group.

When creating many VMs, this process was slow.



Result: 

In the VM and host dialogs, it is now possible to add the entity to an affinity group on the same tab where the VM is added to affinity labels.

 - [BZ 1482465](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1482465) **[RFE] Add sorting for Cluster's columns**

   Feature: Added sorting to more of the Cluster View's Columns. These columns include CPU Type, Data Center, and Compatibility Version.



Reason: Requested via this report.



Result: Now the user can sort by these columns.

 - [BZ 1600059](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1600059) **[RFE] Add by default a storage lease to HA VMs**

   Feature: When HA is selected for a New VM we now set the Lease Storage Domain to a bootable Storage Domain automatically if the user did not already choose one.



Reason: To protect new HA VMs with leases when it has a bootable Storage Domain.



Result: Now a bootable Storage Domain is set as the lease Storage Domain for new HA VMs.

 - [BZ 1647440](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1647440) **[RFE][UI] Provide information about the VM next run**

   Feature: 

A list of changed fields between current and next run of virtual machine is now displayed in the tooltip of vm type icon on the VM list page. 

Reason: 

Until now, it was not possible to see which fields have been changed. 

Result:

 - [BZ 1475774](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1475774) **RHV-M requesting four GetDeviceListVDSCommand when editing storage domain**

   Feature: 

Adding a message while loading a large number of LUNs.  



Reason:

While creating/managing an iSCSI storage domain, there's no indication that the operation may take some long time.  



Result:

Added a message to the spinner dialog:

Loading...

A large number of LUNs may slow down the operation.

 - [BZ 1688796](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1688796) **[RFE] Make it possible to enable Kerberos/GSSAPI debug on AAA**

   A new config variable AAA_JAAS_ENABLE_DEBUG has been added to enable Kerberos/GSSAPI debug on AAA. The default value is false and to enable debug the user should create a new config file /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/99-kerberos-debug.conf with contents



AAA_JAAS_ENABLE_DEBUG=true

 - [BZ 1691704](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1691704) **[RFE] Ignition support for ovirt vms**

   Feature: 

oVirt supports passing ignition configuration for any guest

that supports it, like RHCOS or FCOS. 



Reason: 

The main driver for this is to make oVirt a platform provider for openshift 4.X, where nodes configuration lifecycle is being managed by an operator that serves ignition configurtaion.



Result: 

A guest RHCOS/FCOS guest OS can be configured by passing ignition configuration using the UI or the API

 - [BZ 1595536](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1595536) **[RFE] Support VMs with VNC console on a FIPS enabled hypervisor**

   When a host is running in FIPS mode, VNC must use SASL authorization instead of regular passwords because of a weak algorithm inherent to the VNC protocol. The current release facilitates using SASL by providing an Ansible role, ovirt-host-setup-vnc-sasl, you can run manually on FIPS-enabled hosts. This role does the following:

* Creates an empty SASL password database.

* Prepares the SASL config file for qemu.

* Changes the libvirt config file for qemu.
