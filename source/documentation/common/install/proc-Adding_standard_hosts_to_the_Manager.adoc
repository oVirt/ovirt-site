= Adding Standard Hosts to the {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}

IMPORTANT: Always use the {virt-product-shortname} {engine-name} to modify the network configuration of hosts in your clusters. Otherwise, you might create an unsupported configuration. For details, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#con-Network-Manager-Stateful-Configuration-nmstate[Network Manager Stateful Configuration (nmstate)].

Adding a host to your {virt-product-fullname} environment can take some time, as the following steps are completed by the platform: virtualization checks, installation of packages, and creation of a bridge.

IMPORTANT: OVS clusters cannot contain RHEL 8 hosts. Due to a known issue,  RHEL 8 hosts do not work in clusters whose *Switch Type* is *OVS*. For details, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1809116[BZ#1809116] and link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/901213[Open vSwitch and OpenFlow support for RHV].

.Procedure

. From the Administration Portal, click menu:Compute[Hosts].
. Click btn:[New].
. Use the drop-down list to select the *Data Center* and *Host Cluster* for the new host.
. Enter the *Name* and the *Address* of the new host. The standard SSH port, port 22, is auto-filled in the *SSH Port* field.
. Select an authentication method to use for the {engine-name} to access the host.
* Enter the root user's password to use password authentication.
* Alternatively, copy the key displayed in the *SSH PublicKey* field to */root/.ssh/authorized_keys* on the host to use public key authentication.
. Optionally, click the *Advanced Parameters* button to change the following advanced host settings:
* Disable automatic firewall configuration.
* Add a host SSH fingerprint to increase security. You can add it manually, or fetch it automatically.
. Optionally configure power management, where the host has a supported power management card. For information on power management configuration, see link:{URL_virt_product_docs}{URL_format}administration_guide/index#Host_Power_Management_settings_explained[Host Power Management Settings Explained] in the _Administration Guide_.
. Click btn:[OK].


The new host displays in the list of hosts with a status of `Installing`, and you can view the progress of the installation in the *Events* section of the *Notification Drawer* (image:common/images/EventsIcon.png[]). After a brief delay the host status changes to `Up`.
