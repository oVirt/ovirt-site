### About FOSDEM

This Virtualization & IaaS devroom at FOSDEM is a collaborative effort, organized by dedicated folks from projects such as OpenStack, Xen Project,, oVirt, QEMU, and
Foreman. Featured sessions will include topics such as open source hypervisors and virtual machine managers such as Xen Project, KVM,bhyve, and VirtualBox, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service projects such as Apache CloudStack, OpenStack, oVirt, QEMU, OpenNebula, and Ganeti.

This devroom will host presentations that focus on topics of shared interest, such as KVM; libvirt; shared storage; virtualized networking;
cloud security; clustering and high availability; interfacing with multiple hypervisors; hyperconverged deployments; and scaling across hundreds or
thousands of servers.

Presentations will be aimed at developers working on these platforms who are looking to collaborate and improve shared infrastructure
or solve common problems. We seek topics that encourage dialog between projects and continued work post-FOSDEM.
