=== Evaluating Virtual Machine Custom Properties in a VDSM Hook

Each key set in the *Custom Properties* field for a virtual machine is appended as an environment variable when calling hook scripts. Although the regular expressions used to validate the *Custom Properties* field provide some protection you should ensure that your scripts also validate that the inputs provided match their expectations.

.Evaluating Custom Properties
====
This short Python example checks for the existence of the custom property `key1`. If the custom property is set then the value is printed to standard error. If the custom property is not set then no action is taken.

if os.environ.has_key('key1'):
	sys.stderr.write('key1 value was : %s\n' % os.environ['key1'])
