=== Statistics History Views

Statistics data is available in `hourly`, `daily`, and `samples` views.

[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# SELECT * FROM v4_4_statistics_hosts_resources_usage_daily;
----


To list all available views, run:
[options="nowrap" subs="normal"]
----
# \dv

`delete_date` does not appear in latest views because these views provide the latest configuration of living entities, which, by definition, have not been deleted.
