= Host Firewall Requirements

// Included in:
// PPG
// Install

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s and {hypervisor-fullname}s ({hypervisor-shortname}) require a number of ports to be opened to allow network traffic through the system's firewall. The firewall rules are automatically configured by default when adding a new host to the {engine-name}, overwriting any pre-existing firewall configuration. 

To disable automatic firewall configuration when adding a new host, clear the *Automatically configure host firewall* check box under *Advanced Parameters*.

To customize the host firewall rules, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2772331[].

A diagram of these firewall requirements is available at https://access.redhat.com/articles/3932211.

|Yes (optional)
|H6 |5989 |TCP, UDP |Common Information Model Object Manager (CIMOM) |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |Used by Common Information Model Object Managers (CIMOM) to monitor virtual machines running on the host. Only required if you want to use a CIMOM to monitor the virtual machines in your virtualization environment.

Optional.
|No
|H7 |9090 |TCP |{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}

Client machines |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |Required to access the Cockpit web interface, if installed.
|Yes
|H8 |16514 |TCP |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |Virtual machine migration using *libvirt*.
|Yes
|H9 |49152 - 49215 |TCP |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |Virtual machine migration and fencing using VDSM. These ports must be open to facilitate both automated and manual migration of virtual machines.
|Yes. Depending on agent for fencing, migration is done through libvirt.
|H10 |54321 |TCP |{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name}

{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |VDSM communications with the {engine-name} and other virtualization hosts.
|Yes
|H11 |54322 |TCP |{virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} (ImageIO Proxy server) |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |Required for communication with the ImageIO daemon (*ovirt-imageio-daemon*).
|Yes
|H12 |6081 |UDP |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s |Required, when Open Virtual Network (OVN) is used as a network provider, to allow OVN to create tunnels between hosts.
|No
|H13 |53 |TCP, UDP |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s | DNS Server | DNS lookup requests from ports above 1023 to port 53, and responses. This port is required and open by default.
|No
|H14 |123 |UDP |{hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s | NTP Server |NTP requests from ports above 1023 to port 123, and responses. This port is required and open by default.
|====

[NOTE]
====
By default, {enterprise-linux} allows outbound traffic to DNS and NTP on any destination address. If you disable outgoing traffic, make exceptions for the {hypervisor-fullname}s

{enterprise-linux-host-fullname}s to send requests to DNS and NTP servers. Other nodes may also require DNS and NTP. In that case, consult the requirements for those nodes and configure the firewall accordingly.
