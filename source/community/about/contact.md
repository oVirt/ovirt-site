# Communication

There are a number of ways to communicate with the oVirt Community. [ Mailing lists](/community/about/mailing-lists.html), [IRC](#irc), our [bug tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt) and [our patch review system](http://gerrit.ovirt.org).

## Bug tracker and code review

You can report bugs, or discuss possible solutions to issues, on [the project bug tracker (ovirt project)](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).

We use Gerrit to review patches. To comment on a patch, or submit a patch for review, please read [working with oVirt Gerrit](/develop/dev-process/working-with-gerrit.html).
