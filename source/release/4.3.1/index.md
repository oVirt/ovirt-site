# oVirt 4.3.1 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.3.1 Release as of February 28, 2019.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware™ vSphere™, providing an
awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.
This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6,
CentOS Linux 7.6 (or similar).


For detailed installation instructions, read the [Installation Guide](/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).

To learn about features introduced before 4.3.1, see the [release notes for previous versions](/documentation/#previous-release-notes).


## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### CentOS / RHEL





In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install


`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm)


and then follow our
[Installation Guide](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/).


If you are upgrading from older versions please upgrade to 4.2.8 before upgrading to 4.3.1

If you're upgrading from oVirt Engine 4.2.8 you just need to execute:

      # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm
      # yum update "ovirt-*-setup*"
      # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt Node NG 4.2 you just need to execute:

      # yum install https://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-4.3/rpm/el7/noarch/ovirt-node-ng-image-update-4.3.1-1.el7.noarch.rpm
      # reboot

If you're upgrading from oVirt Node NG 4.3 please use oVirt Engine Administration portal for handling the upgrade.

### Fedora Tech Preview

With oVirt 4.3 we are reintroducing Fedora 28 as platform for running oVirt in tech preview.
More recent builds for Fedora are built for the master branch, so users that want to test them,
can use the [nightly snapshot](/develop/dev-process/install-nightly-snapshot/).
For some of the work to be done to completely restore support for Fedora, see
also tracker [bug 1460625](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1460625&hide_resolved=0).

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as a Hosted Engine on a clean system please
follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#fresh-install)
guide or the corresponding section in
[Self Hosted Engine Guide](/documentation/self-hosted/Self-Hosted_Engine_Guide/).

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#upgrade-hosted-engine)
guide or the corresponding section within the
[Upgrade Guide](/documentation/upgrade_guide/).

### EPEL

Don't enable all of EPEL on oVirt machines.

The ovirt-release package enables the EPEL repositories and includes several
specific packages that are required from there. It also enables and uses
the CentOS SIG repos, for other packages.

If you want to use other packages from EPEL, you should make sure to
use `includepkgs` and add only those you need avoiding to override
packages from other repos.

## Known Issues
- oVirt Node and oVirt Engine Appliance are not available for Fedora 28 due to a bug in Lorax which has not yet been fixed in Fedora 28 (https://github.com/weldr/lorax/pull/612).
- [Bug 1666795 - VMs migrated to 4.3 are missing the appropriate virt XML for dynamic ownership, and are reset to root:root, preventing them from starting](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1666795) - Also affects 4.3.0, easy workaround is to chown vdsm:kvm the disks whigh got reowned to root:root.

## What's New in 4.3.1?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Cockpit Plugin

 - [BZ 1598141](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1598141) <b>[RFE] HE Node Zero should support 'tags' and 'skip-tags' properties</b><br>Feature: Support --tags and --skip-tags options on hosted-engine-setup<br><br>Reason: Have the ability to run ansible roles with tags.<br>Until now Hosted-engine run ansible playbooks with only variables.

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1467332](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1467332) <b>[RFE][Default Route] [IPv6] - Allow and enable default route network with only ipv6 boot protocol</b><br>Feature: Support default route role on ipv6 only networks, but only for ipv6 static interface configuration.<br><br>Reason: oVirt engine should support ipv6 only networks for its existing capabilities<br><br>Result: <br>- it is now possible to set the default route role on an ipv6 only network provided it has an ipv6 gateway.<br>- for engine to correctly report the sync status of the interfaces, all interfaces should be configured with ipv6 static configuration only and an ipv6 gateway should be configured only on the network bearing the default route role. <br>- ipv6 dynamic configuration is currently not supported.<br>- the ipv6 gateway on the default route role network is applied as the default route for the v6 routing table on the host.<br>- it is now possible to set an ipv6 gateway on non-management networks (was previously possible only on the management network).<br>- if more that one ipv6 gateway is set on the interfaces of a host, engine will be in an undefined state: there will be more than one default route entry in the v6 routing table on the host which will cause the host to report that there are no v6 gateways at all meaning that the interfaces will appear as out of sync in engine.
 - [BZ 1671074](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1671074) <b>[RFE] Disable anonymous ciphers for engine <-> VDSM communication</b><br>In this release, the available SSL ciphers used in communication between the Red Hat Virtualization Manager and VDSM have been limited, and now exclude weak or anonymous ciphers.
 - [BZ 1637015](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1637015) <b>[RFE] add option to disable toast notifications per user</b><br>With this release, users can now silence toast notifications.<br>When a toast notification appears, the user can now:<br><br>Dismiss All<br>or<br>Do Not Disturb<br>  for 10 minutes<br>  for 1 hour<br>  for 1 day<br>  until Next Log In
 - [BZ 1669047](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1669047) <b>Support creating a cinderlib data-base in the engine-setup process</b><br>In order to create and use Managed block storage domain, new database should be created for cinderlib to use.<br><br>As similar to the engine database creation, this new database can be created using the engine setup process.
 - [BZ 1673303](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1673303) <b>Prevent setting ipv6 gw on a non default-route-role network</b><br>Feature: Manage the ipv6 default route of a host via restricting the ipv6 default gateways on the host interfaces.<br><br>Reason: Only a single ipv6 gateway should be allowed on all interfaces of a host and it should be on the network assigned the default route role of the network. Allowing to set multiple gateways causes multiple default route entries on the host routing tables which in turn might cause <br>- loss of connectivity with the host on some subnets <br>- host reporting no gateways at all on its interfaces<br>- engine reporting networks as being out of sync<br><br>Result: <br>1. When the default route role is moved away from a network, its ipv6 gateway is automatically removed from the interface.<br>2. After moving the default route role to a new network the user should set a static ipv6 gateway on this network.<br>3. If the host and engine are not on the same subnet, engine will loose connectivity with the host on moving the default route role between networks. This is due to result (1). The user should take precautions to avoid this situation.
 - [BZ 1561539](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1561539) <b>[RFE] Allow adding a new host or reinstalling existing one and switching it to Maintenance without activation</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Allow adding, approving or reinstalling a host without automatically activating it afterwards.<br><br>Reason: <br><br>Sometimes there is performance overhead when activating a host after its addition / re-install / approval, especially when the connection to the storage-domain is problematic. Due to this it's necessary to enable users to add / re-install /approve a host without the host being automatically activated afterwards.<br><br>Result: <br><br>The API will support activate=false matrix<br>parameter in the URL of the request, relevant for add host, install host, approve host operations. <br><br>The WebAdmin will provide "Activate Host After Install" checkbox in add and install host dialogues, and propagate the value of the checkbox to the Engine. <br><br>The default behavior remains activating the host.
