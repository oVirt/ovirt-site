# Reporting a Bug in oVirt

For reporting bugs, the oVirt project uses the Bugzilla bugtracker and testing tool.

For reporting security issues please follow the [security reporting procedure](/community/security/).

## How to create a Bugzilla account

If you don’t have a Redhat Bugzilla account, you can easily create one by following these steps:

1. Visit the [Create a new account](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi) page on Bugzilla.
2. Enter a a valid email address and click **Send.**
3. You’ll receive a verification email from bugzilla@redhat.com. Click the link in the email (or copy it into your web browser).
4. Now enter your name and password and click **Create**.<br>
Congratulations! You now have a Bugzilla account and you can report bugs found in oVirt.

## How to enter a bug in Bugzilla 

Here is how to report a bug found in oVirt:

1. From [Redhat Bugzilla - Main Page](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/), click the [New](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi) link.
2. On the 'pick a classification' page, select **oVirt.**
3. Now choose a product on which to enter a bug. e.g., for issues with the management application, select ‘ovirt-engine’.
4. On the next page, under Show Advanced Fields, choose a Component. Unsure? Simply enter your best guess.
5. In the Version box, enter the project version.
6. Select the oVirt Team. If you are unsure, follow the suggestion from step 4.
