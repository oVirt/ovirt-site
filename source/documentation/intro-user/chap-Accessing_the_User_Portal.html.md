# Chapter 1: Accessing the User Portal

## oVirt Engine Client Requirements

The following browser versions and operating systems can be used to access the Administration Portal and the User Portal.

Browser support is divided into tiers:

* Tier 1: Browser and operating system combinations that are fully tested.

* Tier 2: Browser and operating system combinations that are partially tested, and are likely to work.

* Tier 3: Browser and operating system combinations that are not tested, but may work.

**Browser Requirements**

| Support Tier | Operating System Family | Browser | Portal Access |
|-
| Tier 1 | Enterprise Linux | Mozilla Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) version | Administration Portal and User Portal |
| Tier 2 | Windows | Internet Explorer 10 or later | Administration Portal and User Portal |
|        | Any | Most recent version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox | Administration Portal and User Portal |
| Tier 3 | Any | Earlier versions of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox | Administration Portal and User Portal |
|        | Any | Other browsers | Administration Portal and User Portal |

Virtual machine consoles can only be accessed using supported Remote Viewer (`virt-viewer`) clients on Enterprise Linux and Windows. To install `virt-viewer`, see [Installing Supported Components](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/single/virtual-machine-management-guide#sect-Installing_Supporting_Components) in the *Virtual Machine Management Guide*. Installing `virt-viewer` requires Administrator privileges.

SPICE console access is only available on other operating systems, such as OS X, through the unsupported SPICE HTML5 browser client.

Supported QXL drivers are available on Enterprise Linux machines, Windows XP and Windows 7 machines.

SPICE support is divided into tiers:

* Tier 1: Operating systems on which remote-viewer has been fully tested.

* Tier 2: Operating systems on which remote-viewer is partially tested and is likely to work.

**Client Operating System SPICE Support**
