= Creating a Virtual Machine

This Ruby example creates a virtual machine. This example uses a hash with symbols and nested hashes as their values. Another method, more verbose, is to use the constructors of the corresponding objects directly. See xref:Creating_a_Virtual_Machine_Instance_with_Attributes[Creating a Virtual Machine Instance with Attributes] for more information.

# Get the reference to the "vms" service:
vms_service = connection.system_service.vms_service

# Use the "add" method to create a new virtual machine:
vms_service.add(
  OvirtSDK4::Vm.new(
    name: 'myvm',
    cluster: {
      name: 'mycluster'
    },
    template: {
      name: 'Blank'
    }
  )
)

After creating a virtual machine, it is recommended to xref:Adding_Virtual_Machine_Locating_Its_Service_and_Retrieving_Status[poll the virtual machine's status], to ensure that all the disks have been created.
