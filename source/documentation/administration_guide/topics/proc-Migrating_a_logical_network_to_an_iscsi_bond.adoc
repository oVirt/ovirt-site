= Migrating a Logical Network to an iSCSI Bond

If you have a logical network that you created for iSCSI traffic and configured on top of an existing xref:sect-Network_Bonding[network bond], you can migrate it to an iSCSI bond on the same subnet without disruption or downtime.

.Procedure

. Modify the current logical network so that it is not *Required*:
.. Click menu:Compute[Clusters].
.. Click the cluster name. This opens the details view.
.. In the *Logical Networks* tab, select the current logical network (`net-1`) and click *Manage Networks*.
.. Clear the *Require* check box and click btn:[OK].

. Create a new logical network that is not *Required* and not *VM network*:
.. Click *Add Network*. This opens the *New Logical Network* window.
.. In the *General* tab, enter the *Name* (`net-2`) and clear the *VM network* check box.
.. In the *Cluster* tab, clear the *Require* check box and click btn:[OK].

. Remove the current network bond and reassign the logical networks:
.. Click menu:Compute[Hosts].
.. Click the host name. This opens the details view.
.. In the *Network Interfaces* tab, click *Setup Host Networks*.
.. Drag `net-1` to the right to unassign it.
.. Drag the current bond to the right to remove it.
.. Drag `net-1` and `net-2` to the left to assign them to physical interfaces.
.. Click the pencil icon of `net-2`. This opens the *Edit Network* window.
.. In the *IPV4* tab, select *Static*.
.. Enter the *IP* and *Netmask/Routing Prefix* of the subnet and click btn:[OK].

. Create the iSCSI bond:
.. Click menu:Compute[Data Centers].
.. Click the data center name. This opens the details view.
.. In the *iSCSI Multipathing* tab, click *Add*.
.. In the *Add iSCSI Bond* window, enter a *Name*, select the networks, `net-1` and `net-2`, and click btn:[OK].

Your data center has an iSCSI bond containing the old and new logical networks.
