# oVirt 3.6.5 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.6.5 release as of April 21st, 2016.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization. This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, CentOS Linux 6.7 (or similar) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2, CentOS Linux 7.2 (or similar).

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases,
check out the [previous versions release notes](http://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/releases/).
For a general overview of oVirt, read [the Quick Start Guide](Quick_Start_Guide)
and the [about oVirt](about oVirt) page.

## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm)

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release35 package already installed on your system. You can then install ovirt-release36.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

Once ovirt-release36 package is installed, you will have the ovirt-3.6-stable repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.

If you're installing oVirt 3.6.5 on a clean host, you should read our
[Quick Start Guide](Quick Start Guide).

If you are upgrading from oVirt < 3.5.0, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.5.0 or later. Please see [oVirt 3.5.6 Release Notes](oVirt 3.5.6 Release Notes) for upgrade instructions.

For upgrading now you just need to execute:

      # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
      # engine-setup

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install](Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install) guide.

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow [Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine](Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine) guide.

### oVirt Live

A new oVirt Live ISO is available at:

[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-live/`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-live/)

### oVirt Node

oVirt Node is now released continously. Please refer to the [Node Project](http://www.ovirt.org/develop/projects/node/node/) page for release notes, download and install instructions.

## What's New in 3.6.5?

### Enhancement

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1160094](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1160094) <b>[RFE] Edit the settings of the hosted engine VM in the GUI</b><br>Feature: Switching from per-host editing of the hosted engine vm to the regular engine flow of updating a vm via REST api or UI.<br><br>Reason: Instead of cumbersome, error-prone, local editing the vm.conf on each and every HA host we use the engine itself to edit it. The change should be made in one place, once.<br><br>Result: A change via ovirt-engine is kept in the engine DB and propagated into the OVF_STORE disk on the storage donmain. So it is both shared, and backed-up and highly available.
 - [BZ 1269301](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1269301) <b>RFE: Do not recycle MAC addresses immediately</b><br>Feature: <br><br>Reason: <br>In environment, where VMs are created and removed quickly, acquiring MAC addresses in smallest MAC available order may lead to situation, where there's MAC still used on network, but device using it is different than expected — other devices expects, that this MAC address belongs to some device which was here just moment ago.<br><br>Result: MAC addresses are acquired in cycle. When getting MAC address from pool, pool marks position of last returned MAC, and next time will search for available MAC from this position. This will cause all other available MAC address are 'used' before reusing MAC address returned back to pool.
 - [BZ 1316583](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1316583) <b>[RFE][z-stream clone - 3.6.5] Add Fencing of Ilo3/4 via ssh fencing to RHEV-M</b><br>
 - [BZ 1320092](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1320092) <b>[RFE][3.6 clone] engine-backup should not depend on the engine</b><br>
